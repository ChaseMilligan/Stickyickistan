{"Deities/Kuutar":{"title":"Kuutar","links":["Deities/The-Three-Sisters/The-Three-Sisters"],"tags":[],"content":"Kuutar, the Moon Weaver\nPantheon: Finnish (Incorporated into D&amp;D settings)\nAlignment: Neutral Good\nDomains: Moon, Night, Dreams, Fate\nSymbol: A silver crescent moon with woven threads of starlight\nLore &amp; Worship\nKuutar, the radiant Moon Weaver, is a goddess of the night sky, dreams, and fate. She is a celestial spinner, weaving silver threads of moonlight into the tapestry of destiny. Her light gently guides lost travelers, soothes restless souls, and illuminates the paths of those seeking wisdom in the quiet of night.\nIn some traditions, Kuutar is seen as a sister or counterpart to Päivätär, the goddess of the sun. While Päivätär brings warmth and prosperity, Kuutar grants visions, intuition, and protection under the cover of darkness. Some scholars of the arcane believe she holds sway over prophetic dreams and the hidden knowledge found in the stars.\nHer followers include seers, bards, nocturnal wanderers, and those who find solace under the moon’s glow. Many elves, fey, and druids invoke her name when seeking guidance through omens or celestial movements. Worship often involves moonlit rituals, offerings of silver, and intricate woven tapestries representing the night sky.\nTenets of Kuutar\n\nEmbrace the Night’s Wisdom: Truths are often revealed in the quiet of night—seek them in dreams, starlight, and the unseen.\nWeave Fate with Grace: Every soul has a thread in the great tapestry; do not sever another’s unless it is truly their time.\nShine in the Darkness: Be a guiding light for the lost, a whisper of comfort in sorrow, and a beacon against despair.\n\nManifestations &amp; Servants\nKuutar is said to manifest as a veiled woman clad in silver and blue, with flowing ribbons of moonlight trailing from her hands. Her voice is soft as a lullaby, and her eyes reflect the entire night sky. Her divine emissaries include moon moths, silver-furred wolves, and spectral owls that guide seekers to hidden truths.\nIn some myths, Kuutar is also a weaver of celestial fate, her loom spun from strands of moonlight and shadow. It is believed that when the moon is full, she completes a great design that influences destiny—sometimes as a blessing, sometimes as a warning.\nKuutar &amp; The Three Sisters: A Dance of Moon and Fate\nKuutar, the Moon Weaver, shares a deep yet enigmatic relationship with The Three Sisters, the goddesses of fate who spin, measure, and cut the threads of destiny. While the Sisters dictate the fates of mortals and gods alike, Kuutar is said to weave moonlight into their work, illuminating the unseen paths and subtle choices that shape a soul’s journey.\nA Balance of Influence\nThe Three Sisters—spinners of fate—are impartial and inexorable, their hands weaving the fabric of existence with an unyielding precision. Kuutar, though she respects their craft, offers a counterbalance to their rigid decree. Some myths say that she whispers to the strands of fate as they are spun, softening the harshest dooms and revealing hidden alternatives to those who seek them under the moon’s glow.\nIn turn, the Three Sisters tolerate Kuutar’s influence because they recognize the necessity of choice within destiny. They do not undo their own work for her, but they allow her subtle hand to guide mortals toward paths they may not have seen otherwise. When the moon is full, it is said that the Sisters listen to Kuutar’s counsel, granting brief moments where fate may be rewritten.\nRivalry or Partnership?\nThe nature of Kuutar’s relationship with the Sisters is debated among scholars and oracles. Some see it as a quiet rebellion against the inevitability of fate, while others view it as a necessary partnership—where fate weaves the world, and Kuutar ensures its beauty and purpose.\nOne legend tells of a mortal hero whose thread the Sisters had cut too soon. Kuutar, moved by their courage, stole a silver thread from her own loom and intertwined it with the mortal’s severed fate. This act enraged the Sisters, who do not abide interference, but instead of punishing Kuutar, they challenged her to a wager. If the hero could prove their worth beneath the next three moons, their fate would remain altered. Under Kuutar’s light, the hero triumphed, and thus the Three Sisters begrudgingly allowed the change.\nSince that day, those who wish to challenge fate pray under the full moon, hoping for Kuutar’s quiet intervention. Whether she grants their wish is unknown, for even the Moon Weaver must respect the will of the Sisters—or risk having her own thread severed."},"Deities/The-Three-Sisters/Ashalla":{"title":"Ashalla","links":["Species/Halflings","Regions/Upper-South-Booftown"],"tags":[],"content":"The Green Goddess\nAshalla represents bounty, family, and community, and she is the most widely worshiped among Halflings farmers and healers.

These three faces are personified by the Three Sisters, the primary goddesses of nature in pre-colonization Stickyickistan. They are Ashalla, Darana, and Shadash. Ashalla, the Green Goddess, is the personification of the good aspects of nature. Her symbol is a sheaf of wheat, representing the bountiful and nurturing aspects of nature. She is regarded as the provider of food, sunshine, pleasant weather, and other good natural things. She is also the protector of parents and children. Druids and clerics who worship her serve to aid their communities by healing the wounded, curing the sick and helping crops and animals flourish. While her followers are sometimes stereotyped as peaceful huggers of trees, among their number are far more militant followers who take up arms and magic to defend what is good. Ashalla has strong connections with positive energy, and she is the kindly ruler of the Verdanfey—a fey dimension infused with this power. Darana, the Blue Goddess, is the personification of the balanced and neutral aspects of nature. These are the aspects that bring both weal and woe without discrimination. Her symbol consists of a series of idealized waves, for water is a paradigm of nature’s neutrality. Water gives life, but also takes it away. Water that once quenched a child’s thirst can become part of a flood that destroys a city and drowns that same child. Priests and druids who respect the impartiality of nature worship her. Like her, they seek to maintain a balance and to ensure that the course of nature is not distorted by good or evil. Her more militant followers abide by the saying that nature is cruel but fair. Darana often visits the Feywild and considers it her second home. Shadash, the White Goddess, is the personification of the brutal and destructive aspects of nature. Her symbol among humans and elves is a white rose with thorns dripping blood. Among the more brutal humanoids her symbol consists of bloodied claws. Shadash is the bringer of death, pestilence, and destruction. Priests and druids who regard the furthering of death, destruction and decay as desirable serve her. Like her, they desire to maintain the balance of nature through negative forces: life must be countered by death, health by disease, growth by destruction. While Shadash always has a strong connection to negative energy, in some realities she becomes corrupted by the undead demon Lord Durakor leading to the creation of Nature’s Undead and granting her druids power over those undead. Shadash maintains the Ashenfey—a fey dimension accursed with negative energy. Here she is known as the Lady of Ashes. Her followers abide by the saying that nature is cruel but fair. But mostly cruel."},"Factions/Acolytes-of-Shadash":{"title":"Acolytes of Shadash","links":["Species/Halflings","Deities/The-Three-Sisters/Shadash"],"tags":[],"content":"Native Halflings that worship Shadash, and possess negative energy that power their arcane abilities."},"Factions/Ashen-Shadow-Society/Ashen-Shadow-Society":{"title":"Ashen Shadow Society","links":["The-Legion-of-Steel","Sources/Dragonlance","Stickyickistan","Regions/Nevercough-Island","NPCs/Zara-Blackthorn"],"tags":[],"content":"A replacement for The Legion of Steel from Dragonlance.\nHistory\nThe Ashen Shadow Society is a bounty hunting guild in the realm of Stickyickistan, headquartered in the bustling downtown district on Nevercough Island. The guild was born years ago in the shadowy underbelly of the city, starting as a loose network of ex-military operatives, hired swords, and wands for hire. From these humble beginnings, they quickly realized the immense profit to be made in the arcane chaos of Stickyickistan and its surroundings.\nWith the arrival of foreign settlers and merchants, Stickyickistan experienced unparalleled economic prosperity but also some of the most glaring economic inequalities in the multiverse. In the city’s early days, blue-collar crime ran rampant, and law enforcement struggled to keep up. The Ashen Shadow Society initially thrived by targeting those criminals that the authorities couldn’t catch, earning a reputation as effective enforcers of the law—for a price. Over time, however, their operations expanded significantly as the guild capitalized on the rapid development of Stickyickistanian magitechnology.\nAs magitechnology advanced, so too did organized crime. White-collar crime syndicates emerged, rivaling the traditional blue-collar offenses. This evolution created even more lucrative opportunities for the guild, enabling them to upgrade their facilities, weapons, and equipment. With these advancements, the Ashen Shadow Society began taking on increasingly high-profile and high-stakes contracts, eventually reaching the formidable level of influence they wield today.\nNow, the Ashen Shadow Society operates as a powerful, semi-independent entity that often acts outside the bounds of the law. Though they once worked closely with law enforcement, they now follow their own rules, driven by profit above all else. Membership in the guild is highly exclusive, and only the most skilled and disciplined individuals are granted full status. Those who fail to meet their standards or fall out of favor are relegated to the “Support Squads”—a derisive term for teams assigned the most dangerous and thankless tasks, often serving as expendable assets for the higher-ranking members.\nThe guild’s primary goal has always been, and remains, the pursuit of wealth. “Money” to the Ashen Shadow Society isn’t just gold; it can also mean powerful magical items, influence, or eliminating obstacles to their profit margins. While they do not kill indiscriminately, they are mercenaries in the truest sense, willing to take any job—so long as the price is right. True to their chaotic neutral alignment, they are a dangerous and unpredictable force in Stickyickistan, a group guided by ambition and the allure of gold.\nHierarchy\nWithin the clandestine world of the Ashen Shadow Society, a complex hierarchy governs the inner workings of the organization. Divided into squads and driven by internal competition, this system ensures power dynamics and control within the elite bounty hunter clan. Here is an overview of the hierarchy, where groups of four hold significant influence:\nThe Council of Shadows:\nAt the pinnacle of power lies the Council of Shadows, composed of four highly influential figures within the Ashen Shadow Society. These individuals are the true leaders, pulling the strings from the shadows and determining the clan’s overarching objectives. Their identities remain closely guarded secrets known by the Enigmatic Quartet, including Zara Blackthorn. The Council wields immense authority, making decisions that shape the destiny of the organization.\nThe Enigmatic Quartet:\nDirectly beneath the Council of Shadows is the Enigmatic Quartet, a group of four renowned and enigmatic assassins who serve as the council’s primary advisors. Each member possesses distinct skills and expertise, representing different facets of the clan’s operations. The Enigmatic Quartet holds significant sway within the Ashen Shadow Society, their influence extending to strategic decision-making, resource allocation, and the execution of critical missions. They are known for their elusive nature, rarely seen in public and shrouded in mystery.\nThe Squad Hierarchy:\nWithin the Ashen Shadow Society, squads of bounty hunters form the backbone of the organization. These squads consist of four highly skilled individuals who work together to complete missions and bring in lucrative bounties. Each squad operates with its own internal hierarchy, determined by the squad members themselves. The more money a squad brings in, the higher their status and privileges within the Ashen Shadow Society.\nSquad Ranks:\na) Novices:\nNovices are newly formed squads within the Ashen Shadow Society. They are comprised of bounty hunters who have recently joined forces and are still establishing their reputation. Novice squads are eager to prove themselves and climb the ranks of the organization. They undertake smaller missions and lower-paying bounties as they build their experience and teamwork.\nb) Bloodhounds:\nBloodhound squads have proven their mettle by successfully completing several mid-level missions and consistently bringing in substantial amounts of money. Their exceptional tracking skills and resourcefulness make them formidable adversaries. As Bloodhounds, these squads gain more recognition within the organization, earning access to higher-paying and more challenging contracts.\nc) Ravens:\nRaven squads have established themselves as elite units within the Ashen Shadow Society. Their expertise, experience, and track record of high-value bounties set them apart from the rest. Ravens excel in both stealth and combat, making them versatile and highly sought after for specialized missions. Their accomplishments grant them respect and influence among their peers.\nd) Shadowsong:\nShadowsong squads are the pinnacle of success within the Ashen Shadow Society. They are legendary in their skill, notoriety, and the wealth they bring in. Shadowsong squads have mastered the art of bounty hunting, their prowess unmatched by any other unit. They operate with precision, efficiency, and lethal effectiveness. Shadowsong squads are entrusted with the most dangerous and lucrative missions, and their successes are celebrated throughout the organization.\nSquad Competition and Rewards:\nSquads within the Ashen Shadow Society compete fiercely to bring in the largest sums of money. The more successful a squad is in completing high-value contracts, the more missions they are entrusted with, leading to greater opportunities for wealth and advancement. A squad’s rank determines their cut of the earnings, allowing higher-ranked squads to enjoy a larger share of the bounty.\nAs squads rise through the ranks, they gain access to better resources, equipment, and support from the organization. They also gain recognition and influence among their peers, solidifying their position within the Ashen Shadow Society.\nIt is through this dynamic hierarchy that squads of bounty hunters strive to ascend and establish their reputation, ultimately aiming to catch the attention of The Enigmatic Quartet and the Council of Shadows, the ultimate arbiters of power within the organization.\nSupport Squad:\nThe support characters are recruits that have shown they don’t have what it takes to be on an actual ASS bounty hunting squad, but they can still be useful. Since they are recruits, they have seen the inside of the citadel, therefore if they don’t survive they can’t tell any tales."},"Factions/Ashen-Shadow-Society/Squads/Unit-BH-Umbra-Δ9":{"title":"Unit BH-Umbra Δ9","links":["Factions/Ashen-Shadow-Society/Ashen-Shadow-Society","Regions/Bobo-Bush-Estates","NPCs/Hazeus-Tokenheim","Arcannabis-Extraction","Tokenheim-Extractions-Inc.","Indicus-Sativalin","Regions/Upper-South-Booftown","Weknas-Grasscheeks","Factions/Cough-City-Crew","Cough-City-Thugs","NPCs/Grimjaw","Whisper","Vex","Regions/Ashen-Citadel","NPCs/Zara-Blackthorn","Gilded-Nug","NPCs/Wes-Scantlin","Regions/The-Outback","PCs/Fungi","Regions/Gapejaw-Bog","PCs/Wraith","NPCs/Arcana-Belle","POIs/The-Green-Grimoire","PCs/Baeriggs-Bigbreath","POIs/Puffer's-Pottery","Factions/The-Plague-Plugz","PCs/Xon","Factions/House-Northbourne","Factions/Tribunal-Highblade-Coalition","Dusk-Flame-VII"],"tags":[],"content":"This is a squad of Ashen Shadow Society Bloodhound rank bounty hunters.\nLore\nArcannabis Colossus\nThis unlikely group of misfits came from humble standing in the guild and society as a whole. As a Novice squad they were sent to Bobo Bush Estates to investigate an abandoned botanical garden that locals said had been taken over by some kind of plant horror. They arrived and exterminated an Arcannabis Colossus to the surprise of the guild who thought it was certain they would die.\nPot Potion Press Pilfer\nAfter that they were hired through the guild by a man named Hazeus Tokenheim to recover an item that had been stolen from his Arcannabis Extraction factory Tokenheim Extractions Inc.. Hazeus was certain that one of his smaller competitors, Indicus Sativalin, had a hand in stealing the machine, but he couldn’t be sure he acted alone. The squad went to the factory to investigate the scene of the crime. Here they were able to gain some critical info that the heist would have been much too difficult for one man to do alone, but that was all. Next they decided to try and get in contact with an informant through the guilds sources. They headed to Upper South Booftown to meet a shady individual known as Weknas Grasscheeks, a low time member of the Cough City Crew that agreed to snitch on the gang for money. Weknas was waiting for the squad in an empty lot in front of a strip club, and bodega. Before they were able to get any info out of Weknas they were spotted by some Cough City Thugs, and a fight broke out over Weknas’ apparent snitching. The thugs were defeated, and Weknas revealed the involvement of high ranking Cough City Crew members in the heist of the Arcannabis Extraction machine. They were paid by Indicus to steal the machine, and to protect him while he attempted to reverse engineer it and make the schematics public. Weknas’ final word before sprinting away into the dark alleyways, was that the Machine was taken to Indicus’ secret lab in the forgotten sewer system. The squad used this information to find an entrance to the forgotten sewers where they encountered Indicus’ hired security who they swiftly dealt with. Once inside they snuck past more security, and some alchemists in a magitech hydroponics operation. Just past the hydroponics is where Grimjaw, a Cough City Crew member was sitting. They snuck past him too, and into the main alchemy lab where Indicus was speaking with two other high ranking Cough City Crew members named Whisper, and Vex. The squad was able to hide until Whisper and Vex left the room momentarily, then they confronted Indicus by surprise. Indicus desperately tried to explain his motive to the squad. He explained that Hazeus has had an illegal monopoly on the Arcannabis Extraction market for years, and he has been using his immense wealth, and political cronies to manipulate the laws in his favor. He wanted to expose Hazeus’ corruption, and make the extraction machine available to all in Stickyickistan. It was then that Grimjaw, Whisper, and Vex all re-entered the room. Xon was able to recognize Grimjaw from a description and a wanted poster with a 5000gp reward they saw at the Ashen Citadel. Quickly Xon made the executive decision for the squad to abandon the original bounty, take Indicus’ side against Hazeus, and instead claim the bounty on Grimjaw’s head. A fight ensued, and the squad stood victorious. They took Indicus’ word for future work, and chased in the bounty on Grimjaw. When Hazeus got word of the betrayal, he sent a strongly worded letter to Zara Blackthorn threatening to put a bounty on the squad.\nThe Gilded Nug\nAfter spending some of their money from the bounty they did get, they were sent on their most dangerous mission yet. This mission was not about the money, but about a legendary artifact that the guild has been after for years called the Gilded Nug. The guild had already sent a different squad on a mission to steal it from a Cough City Crew member who had it at the time. While they were undercover as Cough City Crew members, they were able to get close to the member in possession of the Gilded Nug, but one fateful night, the trap house they were hiding out in was broken into. An infamously disgraced singer and bard, Wes Scantlin, from a well known rock band of the realm called Puddle of Mudd, came to take the Gilded Nug for his own nefarious purposes. The Gilded Nug was stolen, but the undercover squad was able to follow Wes to his lair in The Outback. They were led to a place known as Gapejaw Bog where they lost sight of Wes. They reported back to Zara who then relayed this info to Unit BH-Umbra Δ9. They set out into the Outback with a poorly drawn map that the undercover squad made for them. On the trail they faced a few tough fights, and ended up losing Fungi in the forest. The rest of the squad carried on with the mission, and eventually made it to Gapejaw Bog where they narrowly avoided Wes’ magical traps, and spectral defenders. Once in the main cavern, they heard the sounds of Puddle of Mudd being played by Wes. He was jamming on his lyre as the squad snuck up on him. As Wraith closed the distance Wes sensed his presence at the last moment, and went invisible. Wes tried to run away while assuming he was unseen, but Wraith’s blindsight ability allowed him to catch Wes and deliver a stunning strike. This proved to be too much for the infamous bard, and he was cut down before getting to fight back, or explain himself. After Wes fell dead, a magical portcullis dissipated behind him to reveal the Gilded Nug in a glass case. the squad retrieved the Nug, exited the cave, and were extracted by Zara Blackthorn on an airship.\nBugs &amp; Bloodhounds\nThey were taken back to the Ashen Citadel where they received their reward for completing the mission, and reunited with Fungi who was infested with bugs. Zara explained their new Bloodhound rank status to them and gave them all an A.S.S Sending Stone. She them recommended that they get Fungi fixed up right away, and gave them the address of a healer by the name of Arcana Belle. Zara also notified the squad that their quarters are being upgraded, so they would be unavailable for a few hours. Finally she also lets them know that because of Fungi’s failure on the last mission, the whole squad would have to complete a combat training exercise before they would be allowed to take on more guild work. The squad left Zara’s office and went downtown to go shopping. On the way to The Green Grimoire, Wraith and Baeriggs Bigbreath were able to spot some thieves can’t on the sign of a pottery shop called Puffer’s Pottery, and the man behind the counter was a bit too hairy. The thieves can’t read “Poison Shop”, so they went in. They discreetly made it apparent they were not there for pottery, and they were instructed to go behind a curtain and down some stairs in pairs of two. In the basement they met a wererat named Rikki Tweeks, and other members of their gang called The Plague Plugz. They bought some poison, and got an offer to collect some Giant Centipede venom for Rikki at a price of 100gp per vial of venom. While walking around downtown, they noticed an odd couple that seemed to be following them. A tall blonde woman in a flower dress with a sigil adorned staff, and a red dragonborn wearing immaculate armor with a sword at his waist. The squad ducked into an alleyway, and Wraith made an illusion of a brick wall behind them. The duo looked into the alley from across the street, and teleported away. Xon saw them one more time as they approached the Ashen Citadel. This time they were much further away, and just standing watching instead of following. When the squad finally returned from their shopping trip they began the combat training exercise.\nMembers\n\nWraith\nXon\nBaeriggs Bigbreath\nFungi\n\nAllies\n\nThe Plague Plugz\nIndicus Sativalin\nWeknas Grasscheeks\nZara Blackthorn\nHouse Northbourne\n\nEnemies\n\nHazeus Tokenheim\nCough City Crew\nTribunal Highblade Coalition\nDusk Flame VII\n"},"Factions/Ashenfey":{"title":"Ashenfey","links":["Deities/The-Three-Sisters/Shadash","Ashen-Elves","Silverlands"],"tags":[],"content":"Like her sister, Shadash created her own realm. To differentiate it from her sister’s realm, Shadash blended strong threads of negative energy into the weave of the world, thus creating an inherent necrotic taint.\nTo populate her new realm, Shadash coerced neutral and evil fey to join her. She also forcibly transported humanoids, plants, and animals. These transplants faced the harsh challenge of adapting or dying. While many perished, some survived and a few even thrived. A group of elves, the Ashen Elves, created a civilization within the Ashenfey, although this later fell due to treachery and corruption. Most of the realm’s inhabitants are evil, and the others tend to be hard-hearted survivors. Visitors to this realm can expect, at best, cruel indifference.\nThe Ashenfey resembles the natural material world but can be best described as having a profound darkness and harshness. Plants have more and sharper thorns, venom and disease are more intense, colors are more subdued, animals are more savage, the rivers are often sluggish and flow with tainted water, and so on. Because the Ashenfey is infused with negative energy and weak in positive energy, all living creatures in the Ashenfey gain “resistance” to healing and necrotic vulnerability. If a creature is normally vulnerable to necrotic damage, that vulnerability remains. If a creature is normally resistant to necrotic damage, it loses that resistance (but does not gain vulnerability). Creatures normally immune to necrotic damage become resistant while in the Ashenfey. Undead creatures find the negative energy of the Ashenfey pleasant and stimulating. Whenever they make an attack roll or a saving throw, they roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.\nAn odd feature of the Ashenfey is that it contains no native silver ore; instead, it has necrotic iron. This metal can be worked like iron, though it is somewhat heavier. Necrotic iron brought into the Verdanfey grows uncomfortably warm and emits sparks of shadow. Material plane silver brought to the Ashenfey grows slightly warm and erratically emits faint sparks, as if the realm were trying to reject it. Fey silver brought to the Ashenfey grows uncomfortably hot and emits bright sparks. Many creatures of the Ashenfey find silver to be unpleasant, and to some, it is toxic. Inhabitants of the Ashenfey often refer to the material plane as the “Silverlands,” usually in a derisive manner.\nWhile the Ashenfey is a distinct plane, it is coextensive with parts of the material plane. Because of this, the Ashenfey and material plane resemble each other, though there are significant differences. For example, a healthy material plane river is likely to have an Ashenfey counterpart, but this counterpart is likely to be a smaller river with foul water and a sluggish current. There are numerous weak spots in the barrier between the realms that permit intentional and accidental travel between them. These spots are often important to druids, and some are marked with special trees or rings of standing stones—often to warn the unwary of the danger. The opening of such gateways is often marked with a strange weather event, such as a lightning storm with oddly colored lightning and harsher-than-normal thunder. Certain good beings watch for these signs, standing on guard against what might emerge from the Ashenfey."},"Factions/Blighted-Ones":{"title":"Blighted Ones","links":["Valmorra-the-Hollowed","History/Emerald-Blight","Regions/Ruins-of-Spliffholm","Regions/Grim-Forest","Factions/Ashenfey","Factions/Verdanfey","Species/Halflings","Deities/The-Three-Sisters/The-Three-Sisters","Monsters/Corrupted-Acolytes-of-Shadash","Monsters/Lord-Durakor"],"tags":[],"content":"A horde of rotting, deathless horrors, created by Valmorra the Hollowed’s Emerald Blight, that roam the Ruins of Spliffholm in the Grim Forest.

The origins of this infamous gang can be traced back to a time when economic disparities and societal inequalities plagued the city-state.\nStickyickistan, with its booming Arcannabis industry and vast wealth, had created a stark contrast between the opulent elite and the struggling lower classes. It was within the marginalized neighborhoods, where poverty and desperation reigned, that the seeds of the Cough City Crew were sown.\nThe gang’s formation can be attributed to four charismatic and street-smart individuals who shared a common bond of hardship and disillusionment. They were known as the “Founding Four,” and their names echoed through the city as whispers of fear and rebellion: Rocco “Ratjaw” Moreno, Maxine “Viper” Diaz, Ezra “Slick” Evans, and Tara “Torch” Sanchez.\nThe Founding Four, each with their unique set of skills, came together with a shared vision—to reclaim power and control over their lives. They witnessed the exploitation and corruption that ran rampant in Stickyickistan and vowed to forge a path of their own, built on loyalty, camaraderie, and the pursuit of a more equitable society.\nThe name “Cough City Crew” emerged from the squalid conditions of the gang’s early days. The neighborhoods they called home were known for their suffocating pollution and smog, which perpetually lingered in the air, causing bouts of coughing among its residents. It was in these polluted streets that the crew found strength, resilience, and their determination to rise above their circumstances.\nWith their charismatic leadership, the Cough City Crew quickly gained a reputation for their audacity, resourcefulness, and ruthless tactics. They carved out territories within the city, establishing themselves as a force to be reckoned with, challenging the oppressive rule of the wealthy elite.\nThe crew’s activities ranged from illicit drug trade and smuggling to extortion and organized heists, targeting the symbols of opulence that taunted the impoverished masses. Yet, they weren’t solely driven by criminal enterprises. Beneath the surface, the Cough City Crew harbored a desire to bring attention to the plight of the marginalized, to disrupt the status quo, and to dismantle the barriers that kept the lower classes oppressed.\nTheir actions garnered attention from both law enforcement and rival gangs, leading to fierce turf wars and intense power struggles. The Cough City Crew, however, proved to be a resilient force, adapting to ever-changing circumstances, and always finding new ways to defy their adversaries.\nWithin the gang’s hierarchy, the Founding Four retained their status as the ultimate decision-makers, shaping the crew’s strategies and objectives. Beneath them, a network of lieutenants and enforcers ensured the gang’s operations ran smoothly, while foot soldiers proved their loyalty through acts of violence and unwavering allegiance.\nDespite their reputation for criminal activities, the Cough City Crew held a certain twisted sense of honor within their ranks. They abided by an unwritten code, protecting their own and defending their territories with ferocity. They became a symbol of resistance for the disenfranchised, a beacon of hope for those who felt trapped in the merciless grip of inequality.\nThe story of the Cough City Crew continues to unfold, interwoven with the tumultuous history of Stickyickistan. As their influence waxes and wanes, their legacy endures—a testament to the indomitable spirit of those who rise up against the forces that seek to oppress them."},"Factions/House-Highblade":{"title":"House Highblade","links":["Stickyickistan","Factions/Nevercough-Tribunal","Human-Colonialism","Regions/Upper-South-Booftown","Lower-South-Booftown","Regions/Nevercough-Island","Factions/Tribunal-Highblade-Coalition"],"tags":[],"content":"House Highblade is an ancient and influential noble family in Stickyickistan, best known for its military legacy and deep ties to the Nevercough Tribunal.

They are the proud owners of The North Booftown Downs, the city-state’s premier horse racing track, and the founders of the Handler’s Guild, an elite organization specializing in the domestication and training of all manner of beasts, from prized racehorses to exotic war creatures. Their estate in North Booftown, a grand plantation-style home surrounded by vast stables and pastures, serves as both their headquarters and a symbol of their power.\nBut behind this polished reputation, House Northbourne is far more than an animal-breeding dynasty. In criminal circles, they are whispered about as “The Norfies”, a name that strikes both fear and respect. Beneath their pristine façade, they control the largest illicit Alcohol distribution network in Stickyickistan, engage in high-stakes gambling and race-fixing, and operate secretive underground fighting rings.\nThe Handler’s Guild &amp; Magebred Supremacy\nWhile House Northbourne and the Handler’s Guild are officially separate entities, the Guild’s expertise is a direct product of Northbourne bloodlines. Certain members of the family are born with an innate magical talent for calming and controlling animals, allowing them to domesticate even the wildest and most dangerous creatures. This ability has made them the undisputed leaders in the Magebred Animals trade, and their livestock is sought after by nobles, warriors, and merchants alike.\nBut while the Handler’s Guild is respected, House Northbourne is feared. They apply the same ruthless efficiency to controlling their criminal empire as they do to breeding their prized stock.\nThe Norfies’ Criminal Empire\nDespite their public standing, House Northbourne’s true wealth comes from the shadows. Their control of The North Booftown Downs allows them to fix races, manipulate odds, and control gambling syndicates, ensuring that every major bet benefits them in the end.\nBeyond that, they are the largest illicit alcohol distributors in Stickyickistan, running a sophisticated network of secret breweries and smuggling routes. Through layers of obfuscation, and plausible deniability, they employ brewers, alchemists, and mercenaries to produce and transport their contraband, ensuring that Stickyickistan’s thirst for forbidden spirits is always quenched—for a price.\nWhen necessary, they hire outsiders for the dirty work, ensuring that if things go wrong, the blame falls on expendable hands, not Northbourne blood.\nThe Estate &amp; Their Unshakable Rule\nHouse Northbourne’s estate in North Booftown is more than just a breeding ground for elite animals—it is a fortified sanctuary, where business and family affairs intertwine. The plantation-style mansion, rolling pastures, and state-of-the-art stables create an air of refinement, but beneath this elegance lies an unshakable code:\n\nThe Family Comes First. Always.\n\nOutsiders may work for House Northbourne, but only those born or married into the bloodline are truly family. Even marriages are treated like carefully arranged breeding contracts, their genealogy scrutinized as much as their livestock before being approved by the Elders’ Council. Few are ever truly accepted.\nThe Monster Hunter’s Feast: A Luxurious Front for Blood sport\nAmong their many ventures, House Northbourne owns a luxurious restaurant known as Belly of the Beast This high-end establishment is a shrine to Stickyickistan’s legendary monster &amp; beast hunters, its walls lined with taxidermy of rare beasts, enchanted murals, and tapestries depicting grand hunts. Here, the city’s elite dine on exotic meats and rare delicacies, reveling in a world of luxury, status, and danger.\nHowever, behind its refined atmosphere lies a far darker purpose. In the back of the restaurant, the grand dining hall can be transformed into an underground fighting pit, where monstrous creatures, captured warriors, and gladiators battle for the entertainment of the most exclusive guests, and sometimes money. These events are invitation-only, catering to the city’s wealthiest and most dangerous individuals."},"Factions/House-Stonemug":{"title":"House Stonemug","links":["Stickyickistan","Human","Human-Colonialism","Species/Dwarf","Regions/Bongstad","Regions/Nevercough-Island","Factions/Nevercough-Tribunal","Regions/Spliffholm","History/Emerald-Blight","Factions/The-Seekers-of-the-Vein","The-Forgewright-Guild","Misc/Magitech"],"tags":[],"content":"House Stonemug is the youngest of Stickyickistan’s noble houses, yet one of its most resilient and ambitious. Unlike the Human-led noble houses that emerged after Human Colonialism, the Stonemugs were determined to carve out their own Dwarf kingdom in Bongstad—a vision that set them at odds with the ruling elite of Nevercough Island.\nFor decades, House Stonemug resisted integration, seeking to establish Bongstad as an independent dwarven stronghold, free from Nevercough Tribunal’s control. However, their dream ended with the fall of Spliffholm and the outbreak of the Emerald Blight. Faced with the threat of civil war among the dwarven houses, the Stonemugs reluctantly abandoned their claim to kingship, instead solidifying their power through wealth, industry, and enterprise.\nToday, House Stonemug rules not as monarchs, but as masters of trade and industry, controlling a Mining &amp; Jeweller’s guild named The Seekers of the Vein who own the richest mines in Bongstad and dominating the precious metal and gemstone trade. Their influence extends far beyond Stickyickistan, as their immense wealth and resources have allowed them to establish ties with foreign powers throughout the multiverse.\nDespite their economic dominance, House Stonemug still maintains a militaristic edge.

Booftown, predominantly populated by the native halflings who had long suffered under the influence of the human settlers, became the breeding ground for this fierce and brutal gang.\nMOB’s origins can be traced back to a time of deep resentment and seething anger within Booftown. The halfling population had endured years of oppression, their rights trampled upon by the dominating human settlers who controlled the city. As the divide between the haves and the have-nots grew wider, a group of halfling individuals decided it was time to take matters into their own hands.\nLed by four charismatic and ruthless figures, MOB rose to prominence as the voice of the marginalized halfling community. The leaders, known by their street names, were Jinx “Razorblade” Willowbark, Felix “Brawler” Thornfoot, Lexi “Scarlet” Bramblethorn, and Remy “Torchlight” Goldleaf. Each of them brought their unique skills and ferocity to the forefront, earning their positions as the key figures within the gang.\nUnlike their rival, the Cough City Crew, MOB emphasized brutality and intimidation over finesse and strategy. They earned a reputation for their ruthless tactics, leaving a trail of violence and chaos in their wake. Their methods were often crude, employing fear and sheer force to establish dominance within their territories.\nThe name “Mandem on Booftown” reflected their close-knit unity and loyalty to their native district. “Mandem” was a term used by halflings to refer to a tight-knit group of friends or associates, emphasizing the bond that united the gang members. Booftown, despite its oppressive conditions, was their home, and MOB was determined to make their mark within it.\nMOB’s activities included extortion, racketeering, and brutal acts of violence against rival gangs and those who opposed their rule. They targeted the symbols of human affluence and authority, seeking to dismantle the structures that had oppressed their community for far too long. They operated with a blatant disregard for the law, viewing themselves as the enforcers of their own brand of justice.\nWithin the gang’s hierarchy, the four leaders remained at the top, overseeing the gang’s operations and ensuring their message of rebellion reverberated throughout Booftown. Beneath them, lieutenants and enforcers enforced MOB’s rule with an iron fist, instilling fear in the hearts of those who dared to challenge their authority.\nWhile MOB may have lacked the finesse and strategic acumen of their rivals, the Cough City Crew, they made up for it with their sheer brutality and unwavering determination. They were a force to be reckoned with, unleashing their fury upon any who dared to cross their path.\nAs the rivalry between MOB and the Cough City Crew intensified, the streets of Stickyickistan became a battleground for power and control. The clashes between the two gangs were marked by bloodshed and devastation, leaving a lasting impact on the city and its inhabitants.\nMOB’s legacy would forever be intertwined with the struggle for justice and liberation within Booftown. While their methods may have been harsh and their actions ruthless, they served as a symbol of defiance for the marginalized halfling community—a stark reminder that sometimes, strength and brutality were the only means of survival against overwhelming odds."},"Factions/Nevercough-Tribunal":{"title":"Nevercough Tribunal","links":["Dabnar-Nevercough","Stickyickistan","Human-Colonialism"],"tags":[],"content":"\nHead Magistrate Dabnar Nevercough rules with his best intentions in mind, and appoints many figures with questionable motives, but none that would question his authority.\nThe Tribunal considers itself to be the mediator and controller of all other guilds’, and noble houses activities, even though most of its countless decrees are largely ignored.\nThat’s not to say the Tribunal is impotent, however—its legitimacy and reach wax and wane over time depending on economics, cultural trends, and the reaction to other guilds’ overreach.\nAt its best, the ultra-hierarchical Nevercough Tribunal is just, farsighted, and impartial.

Backed by the Nevercough Tribunal, the Highblades led a brutal campaign of conquest across what is now Upper South Booftown and Lower South Booftown, bringing the region under the Tribunal’s control.\nAt the time, these lands were sparsely populated but fiercely defended by numerous native Halflings factions. Despite their resilience, most of these groups were crushed, displaced, or driven into The Outback, where their remnants survive to this day. Through this conquest, House Highblade secured a reputation as an unyielding military force, loyal to the Tribunal and instrumental in shaping the human-dominated colonial order.\nHouse Highblade &amp; The Formation of the Tribunal Highblade Coalition\nOver time, warfare became a business, and House Highblade adapted. While the noble house maintained its ancestral status and holdings, its military forces evolved into the Tribunal Highblade Coalition—an elite mercenary house for hire that serves as a semi-independent military arm of the Nevercough Tribunal.\nNow headquartered in the imposing Highblade Tower on Nevercough Island, the Tribunal Highblade Coalition operates as a neutral yet formidable force, selling its soldiers and war tacticians to the highest bidder while maintaining strong ties to Nevercough’s elite power structure. Most of its commanders and officers hail from House Highblade’s bloodline, ensuring that the noble family still holds deep influence over the Coalition’s leadership. However, while House Highblade remains a noble dynasty, the Coalition is a military enterprise—loyalty is earned through skill, experience, and discipline rather than blood alone.\nEnemies in Business\nSince the decline of Human Colonialism, the Tribunal Highblade Coalition has clashed with rival organizations, not over ideology, but over business. In the world of private security, bounty hunting, and mercenary work, competition is fierce, and THC will not tolerate threats to its dominance.\n\nThe Forgewright Guild’s Warforged Mercenaries – The rise of Warforged soldiers as independent combatants threatens THC’s supremacy. A tireless, obedient soldier-for-hire is bad for business, and the Coalition does everything in its power to undermine, discredit, or eliminate Warforged mercenary operations.\nThe Seekers of the Vein – Prospecting mercenaries hired by the Seekers to guard expeditions and mining sites pose an issue for THC, who once dominated the security contracts for such endeavors. Where once Highblades patrolled the veins of Arcanite, now Seekers’ men have begun carving out their own power, and the Coalition sees them as an insulting upstart force.\nThe Ashen Shadow Society – THC prides itself on discipline, organization, and professionalism. The Ashen Shadow Society, on the other hand, is a guild of lawless bounty hunters and assassins, operating without honor, codes, or restrictions. The two groups have competed over high-profile contracts, and the Highblades view the Ashen Shadow Society as dishonorable killers who make a mockery of their trade. The rivalry has led to violent clashes between the two factions, though neither dares go to open war—yet.\n\nThe Highblade Name &amp; The Future of the Coalition\nWhile House Highblade still exists, it is a noble institution first and foremost, overseeing the family’s estates, political alliances, and aristocratic affairs. It is still influential within the Nevercough Tribunal, but its military power now rests in the hands of the Tribunal Highblade Coalition, which acts as a separate yet closely aligned organization.\nIn Stickyickistan, war is a business, and THC ensures that no one profits from war quite like they do. Whether guarding high-ranking officials, crushing uprisings, or launching preemptive strikes against rivals, the Coalition sells its steel to those who can afford it—all while House Highblade watches from the heights of its ancestral throne, ensuring their bloodline remains at the center of power.\n\nSome are born to nobility. Others fight for it.\nThe Tribunal Highblade Coalition ensures both remain in control.\n"},"Factions/Verdanfey":{"title":"Verdanfey","links":["Deities/The-Three-Sisters/The-Three-Sisters","Deities/The-Three-Sisters/Darana","Deities/The-Three-Sisters/Ashalla"],"tags":[],"content":"In the early nights of the world, The Three Sisters found that despite their love for each other, they could not agree on the proper way to shape the natural world. Rather than fight, they elected to share influence over the material realm. Darana, embodying neutrality, was pleased with the balance between her sisters. While her sisters accepted this compromise, each desired to shape a realm in accord with their own conception of ethics. To this end, Ashalla created a plane parallel to that of the material realm and imbued it with strong positive energy.\nTo populate her new realm, Ashalla invited good and neutral fey to join her. She also extended an invitation to elves, gnomes, and even some dwarves and humans. As for the plants and animals, she either imported them or created them as needed. While many of the inhabitants of the realm are good, not all are. The influence of Ashalla does mean that few evil creatures dwell permanently in the realm, so peaceful visitors will rarely face anything more threatening than cruel pranks.\nThe Verdanfey resembles the natural material world but can be best described as having a stronger living presence: plants and animals are more robust, colors are more vivid, water is clearer, and so on. Because the Verdanfey is infused with positive energy, all living creatures in the Verdanfey gain “vulnerability” to healing and necrotic resistance. If a creature is normally vulnerable to necrotic damage, that vulnerability is suppressed in the Verdanfey. If a creature is normally resistant to necrotic damage, it becomes immune while in the Verdanfey. Undead creatures find the powerful positive energy of the Verdanfey unpleasant and disruptive. Whenever they make an attack roll or a saving throw, they must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.\nAn odd feature of the Verdanfey is that it contains no native iron ore; instead, it has fey silver. This metal can be worked like iron, though it is lighter. Material plane iron brought to the Verdanfey grows slightly warm and erratically emits faint sparks, as if the realm were trying to reject it. Many creatures of the Verdanfey find cold iron to be unpleasant, and to some, it is toxic. Inhabitants of the Verdanfey often refer to the material plane as the “Ironlands,” sometimes in a derisive manner.\nWhile the Verdanfey is a distinct plane, it is coextensive with parts of the material plane. Because of this, the Verdanfey and material plane often resemble each other, albeit with some important differences. For example, a material plane river is likely to have a Verdanfey counterpart, but this counterpart is likely to be a larger river with cleaner water and a faster current. There are numerous weak spots in the barrier between the realms that allow intentional and accidental travel between them. These spots are often important to druids, and some are marked with special trees or rings of standing stones. The opening of such gateways is often marked with a strange weather event, such as a lightning storm with oddly colored lightning and strangely musical thunder. Certain evil beings watch for these storms, eager to intrude into the Verdanfey."},"Factions/Zooka-Mire-Collective":{"title":"Zooka Mire Collective","links":["Golgari-Swarm","Regions/The-Outback","Regions/Zooka-Mire","Stickyickistan","Species/Halflings","Fester-Von-Zaaza","The-Rotwake","Zaazarin","Mortispora","Gutterhive","Sibrek-Hollowspore"],"tags":[],"content":"A small breakaway sect of the Golgari Swarm that has found their way to Stickyickistan, and inhabit a swampy region of The Outback just outside city limits known as Zooka Mire.\n\nThe Zooka Mire Collective is the guild that fuses the opposite values of life and death, fostering growth in Stickyickistan’s decaying communities but also fostering decay in places of growth.\nThe Halflings, zombies, insects, and undead-plant hybrids of Zooka Mire are like one massive, growing, feeding organism, collectively spreading across the land wherever it can fit.\nThe Zooka Mire Collective provide a necessary service in Stickyickistan, in that they dispose of the carcasses, and magitech waste that civilization leaves behind, and mysteriously they also provide sustenance for the forgotten and the downtrodden.\nThey are the scavengers and decomposers at the fringes of the food chain, but yearn to be the predator at the top.\nThe collective is organized more like a single organism than a typical guild: it has a nucleus or nerve center that drives the direction and growth of the collective; elements that collect nutrients and convert them into usable resources; defenses that resist and fight off foreign bodies; and an instinctual drive to survive, reproduce, and overcome.\nThe Zooka Mire Guild Master is currently Fester Von Zaaza an undead necromancer who managed to revive himself after death.\nFester maintains a council of shamans, arcanists, and rogues called The Rotwake.

An Arcanite Cone often belches up Arcanite from the depths of the planet into the crater at the peak of the mountain. Dwarf miners are often employed to venture into the rim of the crater, and extract large amounts of Arcanite which is then used to power the city’s Magitech grid, enchant items, and exported to other elsewhere in the realm.

The pollen from an enchanted Arcannabis plant can be used on the plant that sprouts from a virgin seed. Doing this pollinates the virgin plant with enchanted seeds.

The wood from these trees if often used to power different Elemental Vehicles like airships, and cars.\nAcid Tree\nA creature that hits the tree with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 10\nDexterity saving throw, taking 3 (1d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a\nsuccessful one.\nFire Tree\nA creature that hits the tree with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3 (1d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nLightning Tree\nA creature that hits the tree with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3 (1d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nNecrotic Tree\nA creature that hits the tree with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 10\nConstitution saving throw, taking 3 (1d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nPoison Tree\nA creature that hits the tree with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 10\nConstitution saving throw, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nRadiant Tree\nA creature that hits the tree with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3 (1d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on\na successful one.\nThunder Tree\nA creature that hits the tree with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 10\nConstitution saving throw, taking 3 (1d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nCRAFTING WITH ENERGY TREES\nWhile the crafting of magical items usually requires exotic ingredients, using the wood of an\nenergy tree in the appropriate way can improve an item. But their use in crafting is not without risk.\nThe simplest version of these optional crafting rules is to apply them only to wands that cast a\nsingle spell that does energy damage corresponding to an energy tree. Alternatively, the rules could apply to any wooden item that can cast a spell doing the right sort of damage, such as a staff of fire or a staff of power. If the spells all have the same damage type, then the benefits would apply to all the spells. If the spells have different damage types (or do not do damage)\nthen the benefits would only apply to the energy type corresponding to the wood used. This could be simplified by allowing multiple types of wood to be used in an item so the benefit would apply to all damaging energy spells. Crafting with this material is not without danger and risk. Each hour spent crafting an item with this wood inflicts 1d6 damage of the appropriate energy type on the crafter. For the sake of simplicity, apply the damage at the end of each hour. The crafter must also make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to properly utilize the wood. If the roll fails, roll on the failure table. If the roll succeeds, roll on the success table.\nFailure Table\nRoll d20\n\n1-10 The item is completed but has no special properties.\n11-15 The item is ruined but half the value of the materials can be salvaged.\n16-19 The item is ruined, and all the material is rendered useless and valueless.\n20 The item explodes. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the item\nmust make a DC 15 saving throw. A target takes 8d6 damage on a failed save, or half\nas much damage on a successful one. See the damage and saving throw table.\n\nDamage and Saving Throw Table\n\nDamage Type - Saving Throw Type\nAcid - Dexterity\n\n\nDexterity\n\n\nLightning - Dexterity\nNecrotic - Constitution\nPoison - Constitution\nRadiant - Dexterity\nThunder - Constitution\n\nSuccess Table\nRoll d20\n\n1-5 +1 to Save DC or Attack*\n6-10 1 extra charge\n11-15 +1 damage\n18 A spell casts at 1 level higher at no extra cost in charges.\n19 Roll twice, ignoring another 19 or 20.\n20 Roll three times, ignoring another 19 or 20\n\n*If an item has an attack and a save, pick one."},"Misc/Fist":{"title":"Fist","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Texas Hold ‘em Poker d6 adaptation.\nDictionary\n\nFist = Hand\nSB = Small Blind\nBB = Big Blind\n\nPlaying\nA big and small blind will be identified by using d20 rolls.

The 1st rank are known as Bloodhounds. Their squad’s name is Unit BH-Umbra Δ9.\nBackstory\nBaeriggs Bigbreath is a Dwarf born in the heart of Bongstad, a sturdy warren of carved stone halls, resonating with the sounds of hammers, pickaxes, and the occasional bellow of a Dwarven tavern fight. It is a modest but lively community where resilience was the currency of survival, especially for Baeriggs.\nAs a child, Baeriggs was teased mercilessly for his unusually large nose—a feature that looked comically oversized on his small frame but eventually became a fitting hallmark of his adult face. The name “Bigbreath” was coined by cruel classmates, though it eventually became an endearing title that Baeriggs wore with pride. His parents, however, worried about their son. His intellect was… lacking. Baeriggs was a kind-hearted soul, but his grasp of logic and numbers was tenuous at best, and his tendency to bet everything on impulse made life an endless exercise in damage control.\nBaeriggs’ father was a miner at Mount Zooka, chiseling Arcanite from the volatile crater’s depths, while his mother stayed home, tending to her son’s “special needs.” Despite Baeriggs’ shortcomings in intelligence, his parents saw his potential in one unmistakable strength—his strength. The gods clearly intended him for greatness, and they knew his path would involve a weapon in his hands. Thus, with heavy hearts, they sent him to the House Stonemug mercenary forces, hoping he could channel his raw power into a disciplined career.\nAt the academy, Baeriggs excelled in combat but struggled with everything else. Strategy sessions and tactical drills were an ordeal, but give him a weapon and point him toward an enemy, and he was unstoppable. His classmates nicknamed him “The Blunt” a title that Baeriggs didn’t fully understand but wore proudly.\nOne fateful night, while blowing off steam in Stickyickistan’s bustling downtown, Baeriggs found himself at a dice game. Fueled by Zooka Malt and a rare winning streak, he made a bet so wild it attracted the attention of the wrong crowd. When he lost, he was dragged from the tavern by four shady figures—members of the Ashen Shadow Society, Stickyickistan’s infamous bounty hunting guild. Misunderstandings and miscommunications culminated in Baeriggs being interrogated in a dimly lit room for hours.\nOddly enough, the interrogation became a comedy of errors. The Ashen Shadow Society mistook Baeriggs for someone else entirely, and Baeriggs, in his limited understanding, believed he did hold a secret—a secret so secret that even he didn’t know it. His genuine confusion and unflinching resilience impressed his captors. When the misunderstanding was cleared up, they offered him an unusual proposition: join their ranks.\nBaeriggs accepted, seeing the opportunity as a divine calling. As a recruit for the Ashen Shadow Society, he thrived in combat drills and proved an unstoppable force during missions. While his intelligence often left his squad mates groaning, his sheer determination, strength, and inability to comprehend fear made him an invaluable ally. He even developed an unintentional knack for bluffing—his earnest confusion often read as impenetrable confidence to those trying to read him.\nNow, Baeriggs has been given his own squad, forming an unlikely trio with his comrades, Xon, Wraith, and Fungi. Together, they take on bounties, navigating the chaos of Stickyickistan with a mix of brute force, accidental brilliance, and a healthy dose of luck. Baeriggs still visits his parents in Bongstad when he can, though he refuses to buy any weapons or armor from anywhere but his hometown—a stubborn loyalty to his roots. His gambling habit remains intact, though his squad mates now keep a closer eye on him when dice or Zooka Malt are involved.\nThrough it all, Baeriggs believes his path is divinely guided, and his unshakable faith in the gods (and himself) fuels his zealot’s rage. Whether smashing through a tavern brawl, leading his squad into battle, or confusing his enemies into surrender, Baeriggs Bigbreath is proof that greatness doesn’t require brilliance—just a big nose, a bigger heart, and the biggest mace in the room."},"PCs/Fungi":{"title":"Fungi","links":["tags/Alive","Factions/Ashen-Shadow-Society/Ashen-Shadow-Society","Factions/Ashen-Shadow-Society/Squads/Unit-BH-Umbra-Δ9","Regions/The-Outback","Warforged","NPCs/Zara-Blackthorn","Regions/Zooka-Mire","Regions/Mount-Zooka","The-Mycotic-Forge","Sibrek-Hollowspore","Factions/Zooka-Mire-Collective","Arkanitech-Guild","Misc/Magitech","Golgari-Swarm","Mycoforged"],"tags":["Alive"],"content":"Alive\nCurrently a 1st rank Ashen Shadow Society bounty hunter. The 1st rank are known as Bloodhounds. Their squad’s name is Unit BH-Umbra Δ9.\nBackstory\nFungi, the Forgotten Construct\nFungi has no memory of his origins. His first recollections are a haze of decay and darkness, the air thick with the scent of rot. Then, he was running—his legs carrying him blindly through the vast, moonlit expanse of The Outback. When he blacked out, he awoke in a clearing, surrounded by a perfect ring of button mushrooms. His body, covered in a silk-like white mycelial structure, bore small fruiting bodies sprouting from his form. He had no idea where he was—or even who he was.\nFor a time, Fungi wandered the wilderness, drawn to the quiet wisdom of nature. He studied the mushrooms, lichen, and molds that thrived in the Outback, feeling an inexplicable kinship with them. The forest became both his sanctuary and his teacher, guiding him in ways no mentor could. He discovered that the world respected him as he respected it, and in time, his knowledge of the natural world allowed him to tap into primal magics, manifesting druidic abilities that helped him survive.\nOne day, while walking through the dense brush, he stumbled upon something foreign—a cobbled path. Unlike the soft forest floor, it was devoid of life, its cold, hard stones suffocating under his feet. Curious, he followed it, instinctively spreading small filaments of his own mycelium into the cracks between the bricks. The road led him to a place unlike anything he had ever seen—the sprawling city of Stickyickistan.\nThe city overwhelmed him at first. Towering structures stretched toward the sky, and people moved in endless currents, oblivious to his presence. He avoided the city’s heart, instead lingering at its fringes, finding solace in abandoned places and neglected spaces. A hemp paper processing plant became a reliable source of sustenance, its discarded fibers providing nourishment. Farmers often spotted him at the edges of pastures, carefully collecting cow patties to cultivate the fungal strains he found most fascinating.\nAs he honed his druidic skills in this strange new world, the Ashen Shadow Society (A.S.S.) took notice of him. The guild’s scrying systems caught glimpses of his unique form, and their interest was piqued. They had seen constructs before—Warforged were not unheard of—but none like him. Fungi was something else, something new.\nA novice squad was dispatched to make contact. Fungi, distrustful and wary, resisted at first. However, when one of the operatives presented him with a small stone covered in a rainbow lichen, he was immediately captivated. He took the stone into his hands, admiring the intricate symbiosis of life upon it. It was enough to calm him, and he agreed to accompany them to the Citadel.\nOnce within the city’s heart, he was studied and assessed. His biology was unlike anything the guild had encountered before. They ran tests, probed his fungal structure, and recorded his reactions. A week later, Zara Blackthorn introduced him to his new squad. He was no longer just a wanderer—he was part of something. But even as he settled into his new life, his past remained a void, a missing piece he could not grasp.\nThe Truth Beneath the Mire\nFungi’s true origins lie deep beneath the swampy expanse of Zooka Mire, at the base of Mount Zooka. The Mycotic Forge, a hidden laboratory of decay and rebirth, was the birthplace of his kind. It was here that the infamous Sibrek Hollowspore, an Artificer Mycotyrant of the Zooka Mire Collective, attempted his most ambitious project yet: the creation of a sentient fungal warforged.\nSibrek was once a disgraced biomancer of the Arkanitech Guild, cast out for his obsessive pursuit of necrotic Magitech. He found refuge among the Golgari Swarm splinter-faction, where his heretical experiments were welcomed. In the Mycotic Forge, he crafted the Mycoforged, resurrecting discarded warforged husks by binding them with mycelial networks and necromantic energy. His ultimate goal was the Sporeborne Legion, an undying army of fungal constructs that would spread his will across the land.\nFungi was meant to be the first of this new breed—a living weapon, a fungal horror engineered to command the Mycoforged. But Sibrek made a mistake. He gave his creation a mind, one that yearned not for conquest, but for understanding. Fungi did not see the world as his master did; he did not hunger for decay or domination. He sought knowledge, connection, something more than the cold purpose Sibrek had designed for him.\nTo Sibrek, this was an unforgivable flaw.\nDisgusted with his failure, Sibrek abandoned the project, scrapping it before it could progress. But Fungi would not simply fade away. He saw the suffering of his brethren—the mindless constructs, shackled to their creator’s will. He could not accept it. He would not accept it.\nA rebellion was born in the dark recesses of the Mycotic Forge. Fungi, fueled by newfound defiance, convinced the lesser Mycoforged to rise up against their creator. But they were no match for Sibrek. The rebellion was crushed, the dissenters slaughtered, their bodies repurposed as mere spare parts for future experiments.\nFungi barely escaped with his life. Sibrek struck him down as he fled, his final blow severing something deep within him—his memory, his past, his sense of self. The fungal warforged stumbled into the darkness, his mind shattered, his body weak. And so he ran. Ran through the night. Ran through the Outback. Ran until he could remember nothing but the scent of decay and a room of darkness.\nNow, unknowingly walking a path that may one day lead him back to the Mycotic Forge, Fungi stands at a crossroads. He has found acceptance within the Ashen Shadow Society, but questions still linger in the recesses of his mind. Who was he? Where did he come from? And why does the name Sibrek Hollowspore stir something deep within his bones—a whisper of hatred, of sorrow, of something lost?\nOne day, he will remember.\nAnd when he does, he will return.\nGoals"},"PCs/Wraith":{"title":"Wraith","links":["tags/Alive","Factions/Ashen-Shadow-Society/Ashen-Shadow-Society","Factions/Ashen-Shadow-Society/Squads/Unit-BH-Umbra-Δ9","Warforged","PCs/Xon","PCs/Baeriggs-Bigbreath","PCs/Fungi"],"tags":["Alive"],"content":"Alive\nCurrently a 1st rank Ashen Shadow Society bounty hunter.

When tasks were given to high prestige squads that needed a fill in or just simple fodder, he was put forward. While Wraith was a capable fighter and could hold his own, he was usually in over his head, struggling to survive the chaos. This molded Wraith into a violent machine with impulsive tendencies. As acting fast was akin to survival, he now often acts first without properly surveying the situation. After several of these missions with close calls and near death experiences Wraith began to revel in the risk, danger, and violence. These violent “quirks” can be seen both in combat and in downtime, and are generally seen as a negative by those around him. After six months of being sent into deadly scenarios and managing to survive, Wraith was given the opportunity to join into a newly formed low ranking squad of the A.S.S. While no formal leader was chosen, he immediately labeled Xon as the leader. As Wraith had only been told what to do previously, leading anyone else was a completely foreign concept. He now is dipshit buddies with Baeriggs Bigbreath and has a deep seated hatred for Fungi, seeing the construct as a coward and a freak (ironically).\nPersonality Traits\n\nSocially unaware/awkward, unaware of this fact\nOpportunist, will be open to trying new things.

Suzi was just another kid trying to blend in—until that hot, crowded afternoon in the town square. A bully, sharp-tongued and cruel, picked her out. The taunts turned to shoves, and when the crowd gathered, Suzi’s body betrayed her. Her face twisted, blurred, and re-formed, suddenly mirroring the bully’s smirk.\nGasps became shouts. Monster. Stones flew. People Suzi had trusted, who’d smiled at her yesterday, now looked at her with murder in their eyes. She ran, blood dripping, lungs burning, past the gates that slammed shut behind her.\nThat was the day Suzi died—and Nix was born, forged in the hate of a town too small to understand.\nFrom that day on, Nix wandered the open road, lost and adrift, until the journey led to a city where they began practicing the art of shape changing. It wasn’t long before they caught the eye of a reclusive older gnome, an investigator with a drinking problem named Zook. The gnome was hired to look into a series of odd circumstances: petty crimes with seemingly innocent people being accused, but no one could figure out the truth. When the gnome discovered that Nix’s ability was the cause—turning into others and unknowingly leaving confusion in their wake—he decided to take Nix under his care. He taught them the art of observation, deduction, and deception. Life with the mentor was a mix of late-night lessons, cryptic advice, and long silences, often interrupted by the gnome’s drinking.\nWhen the gnome passed away, Nix found themselves living as him for a time, not out of necessity, but out of a deep desire to honor their mentor’s legacy. It wasn’t a burden; it was a chance to continue his work. Eventually, Nix left, boarding a ship to Stickyickistan, their next chapter unfolding.\nStill under the guise of their late boozy mentor, Zook, Nix found work in North Booftown with House Northbourne, a gang that distributed illicit alcohol among other nefarious dealings. Using alchemical knowledge, Nix transformed alcohol into a wax-like substance, which was then sold at a bookstore as candles. The laboratory was located deep under a cemetery, accessed through one of the mausoleums. The pay was not great, nor were the working conditions, but it suited Nix’s needs, even as they grappled with their mentor’s dependence on alcohol, which had become their own. One late night while crafting, an enraged spirit descended upon the workshop, furious over the disturbances near its resting place. Hurling beakers, solvents, burners, and any other objects in the room with the power of its shattered psyche, it eventually tossed Nix—slamming them into a wall near the staircase that led back to the surface. As Nix was getting back up, one of the burners that had been thrown ignited a nearby barrel of liquor. The resulting explosion engulfed the underground facility in flames, costing Nix their right arm.\nIt was many days before Nix woke in a nearby church, bandaged and drained of energy. Gone was Zook’s face—staring back at them in a basin of water was the image of their childhood bully, a late-teenage human girl. A local had found them unconscious near the mausoleum entrance in that form, assuming it to be their true identity. Weakened and disoriented, Nix remained at the church for weeks, regaining their strength. When asked their name, they gave the best answer they could think of—Xon. Not the bully’s name, but close enough, a placeholder for yet another life.\nAs their body recovered, they discovered something else had changed. The calamity had done more than take their arm—it had awakened something within them. Nix could now manipulate blood in unnatural ways, altering their own flow and pressure at will, even igniting exposed blood into flame.

Centuries ago, the legendary artificer Draza Zharrah, a Dwarf master of Bongstad, sought to push the boundaries of arcane craftsmanship. Dissatisfied with the limitations of traditional materials, she studied the arcane-infused flora of Verdanfey and Ashenfey, two Fey-touched dimensions teeming with extreme magical energies.\nInspired, she sought to grow trees infused with elemental forces, believing that wood shaped by the primal energies of fire, lightning, and void would yield unparalleled arcane foci and weapons. Through decades of trial and error, Elemental Trees were born—living conduits of elemental magic, capable of producing staffs, wands, and magitech components that could channel magic like never before.\nHowever, when experimenting with psychic energy, the trees developed intelligence. Unwilling to use sentient beings as raw materials, Draza abandoned this line of research, and soon after, the first Treants of Stickyickistan began to appear. Some scholars argue that these creatures were simply awakened by exposure to Arcanite —others claim they were the trees’ way of fighting back.\nThe Rise and Fall of Spliffholm\nDraza’s discoveries attracted power-hungry mages, warlords, and industrialists, leading to the rise of Spliffholm, a booming fortress-city built around magitech forestry, elemental harvesting, and siegecraft innovation. The powerful trees grown here were used in warships, siege engines, and devastating magitech weaponry that would shape the course of Stickyickistan’s expansion.\nAt its height, Spliffholm rivaled Nevercough Island itself, producing magically enhanced warships, towering arcane ballistae, and golem-infused war machines. Its ruling merchant houses grew arrogant and greedy, hoarding wealth and exploiting forced labor, particularly from native Halflings and minor elemental creatures.\nBut magic, greed, and unchecked ambition are a volatile mix.\nThe Arcane Civil War and the Cataclysm\nAs power struggles erupted among mages, priests, and mercenary factions, the city fell into civil war. Industrial sabotage, magical duels, and full-scale battles tore the city apart, with factions summoning fiends, creating unstable war golems, and using necromantic plagues to gain the upper hand.\nAt the peak of the conflict, the Necromancer Valmorra the Hollowed unleashed her ultimate weapon—the Emerald Blight, a magical plague that turned the living into mindless, fungal-infested undead. While her intent was to control the fallen, the Blight quickly spiraled out of control, transforming Spliffholm into a nightmarish wasteland of rotting, deathless horrors.\nRealizing the catastrophe would consume all of Stickyickistan, an unlikely alliance of native Halfling druids, Ashenfey, Verdanfey, Elemental creatures, and arcanists from the other cities —some of whom had been enslaved in Spliffholm’s industrial mills—banded together to seal the undead within the ruins. They planted a barrier of Radiant Trees around the city, whose divine-infused wood burns away the Blight. To this day, the trees grow unchecked, keeping the cursed ruins locked away.\nThe Grim Forest and the Forgotten Horrors\nNow, the Ruins of Spliffholm lie deep within the Grim Forest, a twisted land where the boundaries between life and death blur. The Radiant Trees still stand, holding the Emerald Blight and its endless undead legions at bay, but the deeper one ventures into the ruins, the more unstable magic becomes.\nTreants, once protectors, now stalk the land with vengeful purpose, ensuring that no one disturbs the cursed city. Ancient automatons, rogue magitech constructs, horrific experimental plant life, and forgotten war beasts still roam, remnants of the industrial nightmare that once ruled here. The Blighted Ones—undead that have evolved within the Emerald Blight—whisper in the shadows, yearning to spread their disease beyond the walls of their prison.\nFew venture into The Grim Forest, and fewer still return.

Led by a dwarven war lord, who they crowned their king, named Thordal “Three-Chins” Stonemug, the dwarven colonists attempted to start a nation of their own. They were eventually overtaken by the sheer ingenuity of the humans from Stickyickistan that had been expanding much more rapidly than Bongstad. This is the main reason why the dwarf population is so segregated from all other species in the city.

Here, they’ve mastered the arts of smuggling, subterfuge, and survival, making them indispensable to the city’s underworld.\nThough many halflings live honest lives as shopkeepers, brewers, and traders, a significant number are involved in illicit operations, including black-market enchantments, poison sales, and high-stakes gambling rings. The Mandem on Booftown (MOB) is the most infamous of these groups—a halfling-exclusive gang that controls much of The Ashtray’s backstreets, specializing in contraband Arcannabis strains and exotic poisons.\nDespite their criminal reputation, halflings are fiercely communal, sticking together in tight-knit families and extended kin networks. Whether sharing a meal, a smoke, or a scheme, they pride themselves on loyalty—but cross one, and you’ll find out just how good a halfling can be at making problems disappear.\nFaith in The Three Sisters\nBefore colonization, the halflings of Stickyickistan were deeply connected to the Three Sisters, the goddesses who personify nature’s balance between good, neutrality, and destruction.

This bustling metropolis, inhabited by approximately 27 million denizens, thrives as a tightly woven tapestry of terraced dwellings. At the heart of it all lies the Capitol building, perched upon Nevercough Island, an idyllic smaller landmass embraced by an inlet on the main island.\nAscending from the base of the volcano, the upscale residences extend into the lush jungle, offering breathtaking vistas that stretch out to the majestic ocean. The colossal canopy of tropical trees, reminiscent of gargantuan redwoods, provides a natural shield, safeguarding inhabitants from the perilous potential of volcanic eruptions. In stark contrast, the slums that cling to the mountainside exude an aroma of brimstone and sulfur, perpetually shrouded in an ethereal haze of ash and smoke, reminiscent of the favelas of Brazil. These settlements wind their way upward, nearly reaching the rim of the crater in certain areas. Above the slums, an industrial district clings to the rim and delves deeper into the crater, thriving amidst the volcanic terrain.\nThe centerpiece of this mesmerizing landscape, affectionately known to the locals as Mount Zooka, is a unique marvel—a type of volcano called an Arcanite Cone. These particular cones rise above rich Arcanite deposits, their imposing forms resembling vast mounds of ebony volcanic rock. Near the base, dark, sluggish lava courses through the terrain, surrounding the volcano, while at its zenith, a massive crater brims with bubbling magma. During eruptions, projectiles ranging from golf ball-sized to soccer ball-sized volcanic rocks, globules of molten magma, and occasionally, chunks of Arcanite, burst forth from the crater. After each eruption, the valuable ores, minerals, and particularly the Arcanite, are harvested from the crater. Arcanite, a raw magical element typically found deep within the earth, can be extracted and purified, granting magical properties to weapons and armor. To facilitate this process, the government of Stickyickistan, aka the Nevercough Tribunal, has established makeshift mines and outposts within and around the crater, providing shelter for workers during their resource-gathering shifts.\nThe island’s soil boasts copious amounts of nutrients, enriched by high traces of Arcanite. Consequently, the surrounding flora and fauna flourish with extraordinary fertility and magical essence. This mystical essence imbues the forest creatures, vegetation, and sometimes city dwellers, with potent magic. Dabnar Nevercough, the esteemed Chief Magistrate, assumes the mantle of both head of state and Supreme Judge, governing over the realm of Stickyickistan. While Arcannabis stands as the city-state’s primary export, considerable profits are also garnered from the trade and sale of Arcanite and other natural resources. Notably, since the arrival of human colonists, alcohol has been outlawed within the region due to its perceived threat to the Arcannabis market. Consequently, Zooka Malt, a beverage derived from Arcannabis buds, has emerged as the main alternative to traditional ale, presenting a diverse array of Arcannabis-infused concoctions for the denizens to indulge in. Nevercough Island serves as a haven for high-end establishments, housing exclusive shops vending exquisite goods, a courthouse, a museum, a fine art gallery, and esteemed libraries, among other cultural landmarks.\nSouth of Nevercough Island, and north of the volcano, lies an area known as Lower South Booftown—affectionately referred to as Booftown. This middle-class district paints a tranquil suburban picture with its small, family-owned shops and public parks. A constant flow of thick, dark, and slow-moving lava serves as a natural boundary, separating Lower South Booftown from its northern counterpart, aptly named Upper South Booftown or “The Ashtray” due to its gritty nature. The Ashtray harbors the city’s darker underbelly and plays host to some of the realm’s most notorious gangs. Among them, the MOB (Mandem on Booftown) and the CCC (Cough City Crew) dominate the landscape, engaging in relentless clashes over territorial disputes, control of illicit substances, weapons, arcane artifacts, and monetary gains. Upper South Booftown primarily houses the native Halfling population, alongside other minority groups. MOB remains an exclusively Halfling gang, while the CCC boasts a more diverse membership, encompassing various races, including Halflings, Humans, and other groups.\nTo the east of the volcano lies Bobo Bush Estates, a realm where opulent mansions and lavish villas serve as the abodes for influential figures from Stickyickistan. North of Nevercough Island, the region of North Booftown thrives as the agricultural heartland of Stickyickistan. This area also harbors a Human criminal enterprise known as House Northbourne, specializing in extortion, gambling, and the illicit distribution of bootleg alcohol. They cleverly employ a bookmaking business as a front for money laundering and maintain ownership of the North Booftown Downs, a renowned horse race track. The Norfies have faced accusations of engaging in illegal gambling and manipulating race outcomes. There is also a Dwarven settlement Dug into the base of Mount Zooka on the west side of the city called Bongstad. The Dwarves have cleverly engineered a magical geothermal power generation system that powers a majority of the Magitech grid in the realm. Some of the best forges on the island can be found in this part of town.\nBeyond the confines of the city lies what the residents of Stickyickistan call The Outback, a colossal expanse of arcane forests, swamps, bogs, mountain ranges, jungle, rainforest, beaches, and a small area of badlands and desert at the southern end. The Outback is inhabited by creatures from all over the material plane and beyond. Due to the naturally high levels of pure magic spewed from Mount Zooka, the island has been a hotspot in the multiverse.\nPast Stickyickistan\nHuman Colonialism\nIn the annals of the multiverse, nestled amidst the turbulent seas, there exists an island now known as Stickyickistan. This extraordinary place, with its vibrant tapestry of cultures and bountiful resources, has a captivating history that intertwines the rise of its economy with the clash of two diverse civilizations.\nLong ago, the few, and only humanoid creatures on the island were a tranquil and harmonious community of halflings. They had a polytheistic faith in The Three Sisters, lived in harmony with the land, and all the other creatures in it, cherishing the bountiful gifts bestowed upon them by the arcane nature of the island. The island flourished, its soil fertile and its forests teeming with life. But fate had other plans in store.\nIn a wave of Human Colonialism, ambitious settlers arrived upon the shores of Stickyickistan. Eager to claim the island’s vast wealth for their own, they viewed the halflings as obstacles to their ambitions. Driven by greed and a desire to control the land’s resources, the humans launched a forceful invasion, shattering the serenity that once enveloped the island. Forming the nation of Stickyickistan, and Nevercough City on what they now call Nevercough Island\nAmidst the chaos and conflict, the halflings valiantly resisted. Yet, outnumbered and outmatched, their hopes for victory dwindled. Recognizing the desperate situation, their wise leaders made a fateful decision—a negotiation for survival. A pact was struck, granting the halflings a protected enclave within the new nation now known as Upper South Booftown, and acknowledging their rights to partake in the newfound prosperity.\nAs the human settlers sought to establish dominion over the land, they discovered a remarkable resource—an extraordinary plant they called Arcannabis. Its magical properties became the foundation of Stickyickistan’s economy, revolutionizing trade and transforming the island into a hub of prosperity. The potent properties of Arcannabis, when harnessed, granted individuals heightened senses, expanded magical abilities, and even visions into realms unseen.\nArcannabis Cultivation quickly became a specialized art, passed down from generation to generation. Vast fields of the magical marijuana stretched across the landscape, tended to by expert cultivators who nurtured the plants with care and reverence. The nation’s wealth soared as merchants flocked from distant lands to partake in the arcane wonders Stickyickistan had to offer.\nUnderneath the bustling trade and enchanting haze, however, lay the remnants of a fractured society. The divide between the human settlers and the halfling community remained palpable, their coexistence marred by lingering distrust and cultural clashes. Nevertheless, as the economy thrived, the nation’s leaders endeavored to bridge the gaps and foster unity among its diverse inhabitants.\nOver time, a unique blend of cultures emerged in Stickyickistan. The fusion of halfling traditions and human innovations birthed a captivating tapestry of art, music, and cuisine. Festivals celebrating both the halflings’ reverence for nature and the humans’ entrepreneurial spirit became the heartbeat of the city-state, uniting the population under a shared sense of identity. This is not to say that all racial tensions have gone away.\nStickyickistan, with its majestic architecture, aromatic markets, and vibrant streets, stands today as a testament to the resilience and adaptability of its people. The island’s history, forever marked by the invasion and subsequent coexistence, serves as a reminder of the complexities of cultural exchange and the potential for harmony amidst disparate communities.\nAs the waves lap against the shores of Stickyickistan, the echoes of its past reverberate through the bustling city streets. The legacy of the halflings’ ancestral connection to the land and the humans’ quest for prosperity interweave to form the fabric of this remarkable island city-state, forever entwined with the enigmatic allure of Arcanite.\nThe Making of a City State\nStickyickistan wasn’t always a city state. it was once a nation with multiple population centers. The main Human settlement on Nevercough Island was named Nevercough City after their patriarchal noble family. A Dwarf settlement was excavated into the base of Mount Zooka across the Percolat Inlet from Nevercough City which they named Bongstad. Then there was the native Halflings reserved land which was not given an official name, but it was positioned right between a giant lava river, and the slopes of Mount Zooka making it barely habitable.\nThose settlements were all more or less on the coast of the nation, but there was one more settlement being setup much further inland. This city settlement was started by a legendary Dwarf artificer named Draza Zharrah after her discovery of Elemental Trees in The Outback. Thus Spliffholm was born.\nAt its height, Spliffholm rivaled Nevercough City itself, producing magically enhanced warships, towering arcane ballistae, and golem-infused war machines. Its ruling merchant houses grew arrogant and greedy, hoarding wealth and exploiting forced labor, particularly from native Halflings and minor elemental creatures.\nBut magic, greed, and unchecked ambition are a volatile mix.\nThe Arcane Civil War and the Cataclysm\nAs power struggles erupted among mages, priests, and mercenary factions, the city fell into civil war. Industrial sabotage, magical duels, and full-scale battles tore the city apart, with factions summoning fiends, creating unstable war golems, and using necromantic plagues to gain the upper hand.\nAt the peak of the conflict, the Necromancer Valmorra the Hollowed unleashed her ultimate weapon—the Emerald Blight, a magical plague that turned the living into mindless, fungal-infested undead. While her intent was to control the fallen, the Blight quickly spiraled out of control, transforming Spliffholm into a nightmarish wasteland of rotting, deathless horrors.\nRealizing the catastrophe would consume all of Stickyickistan, an unlikely alliance of native Halfling druids, Ashenfey, Verdanfey, Elemental creatures, and arcanists from the other cities —some of whom had been enslaved in Spliffholm’s industrial mills—banded together to seal the undead within the ruins. They planted a barrier of Radiant Trees around the city, whose divine-infused wood burns away the Blight. To this day, the trees grow unchecked, keeping the cursed Ruins of Spliffholm locked away.\nAftermath\nReeling from the horrors they witnessed in Spliffholm, veterans of the Nevercough Tribunal military forces, and its allies vowed to make sure that they would not suffer the same fate as Spliffholm. They decided to unite all the settlements of the alliance, and form a city state named Stickyickistan. This decision was not unanimous, but was a democratic majority. All the original settlement cities eventually grew into one another finally making them indistinguishable. There are still many that identify more with the region of the city state they are from than the city state itself. Mostly the dwarves of Bongstad since that area remains the most racially homogenous of them all."},"index":{"title":"Welcome to Stickyickistan","links":["Sources/Eberron","Sources/Ravnica","Sources/Dragonlance","Stickyickistan","Regions/The-Outback"],"tags":[],"content":"WARNING FOR PLAYERS\nI am somewhat trusting you to not meta-game you little rat fucks.
