She is a celestial spinner, weaving silver threads of moonlight into the tapestry of destiny. Her light gently guides lost travelers, soothes restless souls, and illuminates the paths of those seeking wisdom in the quiet of night.\nIn some traditions, Kuutar is seen as a sister or counterpart to Päivätär, the goddess of the sun. While Päivätär brings warmth and prosperity, Kuutar grants visions, intuition, and protection under the cover of darkness. Some scholars of the arcane believe she holds sway over prophetic dreams and the hidden knowledge found in the stars.\nHer followers include seers, bards, nocturnal wanderers, and those who find solace under the moon’s glow. Many elves, fey, and druids invoke her name when seeking guidance through omens or celestial movements. Worship often involves moonlit rituals, offerings of silver, and intricate woven tapestries representing the night sky.\nTenets of Kuutar\n\nEmbrace the Night’s Wisdom: Truths are often revealed in the quiet of night—seek them in dreams, starlight, and the unseen.\nWeave Fate with Grace: Every soul has a thread in the great tapestry; do not sever another’s unless it is truly their time.\nShine in the Darkness: Be a guiding light for the lost, a whisper of comfort in sorrow, and a beacon against despair.\n\nManifestations &amp; Servants\nKuutar is said to manifest as a veiled woman clad in silver and blue, with flowing ribbons of moonlight trailing from her hands. Her voice is soft as a lullaby, and her eyes reflect the entire night sky. Her divine emissaries include moon moths, silver-furred wolves, and spectral owls that guide seekers to hidden truths.\nIn some myths, Kuutar is also a weaver of celestial fate, her loom spun from strands of moonlight and shadow. It is believed that when the moon is full, she completes a great design that influences destiny—sometimes as a blessing, sometimes as a warning.\nKuutar &amp; The Three Sisters: A Dance of Moon and Fate\nKuutar, the Moon Weaver, shares a deep yet enigmatic relationship with The Three Sisters, the goddesses of fate who spin, measure, and cut the threads of destiny. While the Sisters dictate the fates of mortals and gods alike, Kuutar is said to weave moonlight into their work, illuminating the unseen paths and subtle choices that shape a soul’s journey.\nA Balance of Influence\nThe Three Sisters—spinners of fate—are impartial and inexorable, their hands weaving the fabric of existence with an unyielding precision. Kuutar, though she respects their craft, offers a counterbalance to their rigid decree. Some myths say that she whispers to the strands of fate as they are spun, softening the harshest dooms and revealing hidden alternatives to those who seek them under the moon’s glow.\nIn turn, the Three Sisters tolerate Kuutar’s influence because they recognize the necessity of choice within destiny. They do not undo their own work for her, but they allow her subtle hand to guide mortals toward paths they may not have seen otherwise. When the moon is full, it is said that the Sisters listen to Kuutar’s counsel, granting brief moments where fate may be rewritten.\nRivalry or Partnership?\nThe nature of Kuutar’s relationship with the Sisters is debated among scholars and oracles. Some see it as a quiet rebellion against the inevitability of fate, while others view it as a necessary partnership—where fate weaves the world, and Kuutar ensures its beauty and purpose.\nOne legend tells of a mortal hero whose thread the Sisters had cut too soon. Kuutar, moved by their courage, stole a silver thread from her own loom and intertwined it with the mortal’s severed fate. This act enraged the Sisters, who do not abide interference, but instead of punishing Kuutar, they challenged her to a wager. If the hero could prove their worth beneath the next three moons, their fate would remain altered. Under Kuutar’s light, the hero triumphed, and thus the Three Sisters begrudgingly allowed the change.\nSince that day, those who wish to challenge fate pray under the full moon, hoping for Kuutar’s quiet intervention. Whether she grants their wish is unknown, for even the Moon Weaver must respect the will of the Sisters—or risk having her own thread severed."},"Deities/The-Three-Sisters/Ashalla":{"title":"Ashalla","links":["Species/Halflings","Regions/Upper-South-Booftown"],"tags":[],"content":"The Green Goddess\nAshalla represents bounty, family, and community, and she is the most widely worshiped among Halflings farmers and healers.

These three faces are personified by the Three Sisters, the primary goddesses of nature in pre-colonization Stickyickistan. They are Ashalla, Darana, and Shadash. Ashalla, the Green Goddess, is the personification of the good aspects of nature. Her symbol is a sheaf of wheat, representing the bountiful and nurturing aspects of nature. She is regarded as the provider of food, sunshine, pleasant weather, and other good natural things. She is also the protector of parents and children. Druids and clerics who worship her serve to aid their communities by healing the wounded, curing the sick and helping crops and animals flourish. While her followers are sometimes stereotyped as peaceful huggers of trees, among their number are far more militant followers who take up arms and magic to defend what is good. Ashalla has strong connections with positive energy, and she is the kindly ruler of the Verdanfey—a fey dimension infused with this power. Darana, the Blue Goddess, is the personification of the balanced and neutral aspects of nature. These are the aspects that bring both weal and woe without discrimination. Her symbol consists of a series of idealized waves, for water is a paradigm of nature’s neutrality. Water gives life, but also takes it away. Water that once quenched a child’s thirst can become part of a flood that destroys a city and drowns that same child. Priests and druids who respect the impartiality of nature worship her. Like her, they seek to maintain a balance and to ensure that the course of nature is not distorted by good or evil. Her more militant followers abide by the saying that nature is cruel but fair. Darana often visits the Feywild and considers it her second home. Shadash, the White Goddess, is the personification of the brutal and destructive aspects of nature. Her symbol among humans and elves is a white rose with thorns dripping blood. Among the more brutal humanoids her symbol consists of bloodied claws. Shadash is the bringer of death, pestilence, and destruction. Priests and druids who regard the furthering of death, destruction and decay as desirable serve her. Like her, they desire to maintain the balance of nature through negative forces: life must be countered by death, health by disease, growth by destruction. While Shadash always has a strong connection to negative energy, in some realities she becomes corrupted by the undead demon Lord Durakor leading to the creation of Nature’s Undead and granting her druids power over those undead. Shadash maintains the Ashenfey—a fey dimension accursed with negative energy. Here she is known as the Lady of Ashes. Her followers abide by the saying that nature is cruel but fair. But mostly cruel."},"Factions/Ashen-Shadow-Society/Ashen-Shadow-Society":{"title":"Ashen Shadow Society","links":["The-Legion-of-Steel","Sources/Dragonlance","Stickyickistan","Regions/Nevercough-Island","NPC's/Zara-Blackthorn"],"tags":[],"content":"A replacement for The Legion of Steel from Dragonlance.\nHistory\nThe Ashen Shadow Society is a bounty hunting guild in the realm of Stickyickistan, headquartered in the bustling downtown district on Nevercough Island. The guild was born years ago in the shadowy underbelly of the city, starting as a loose network of ex-military operatives, hired swords, and wands for hire. From these humble beginnings, they quickly realized the immense profit to be made in the arcane chaos of Stickyickistan and its surroundings.\nWith the arrival of foreign settlers and merchants, Stickyickistan experienced unparalleled economic prosperity but also some of the most glaring economic inequalities in the multiverse. In the city’s early days, blue-collar crime ran rampant, and law enforcement struggled to keep up. The Ashen Shadow Society initially thrived by targeting those criminals that the authorities couldn’t catch, earning a reputation as effective enforcers of the law—for a price. Over time, however, their operations expanded significantly as the guild capitalized on the rapid development of Stickyickistanian magitechnology.\nAs magitechnology advanced, so too did organized crime. White-collar crime syndicates emerged, rivaling the traditional blue-collar offenses. This evolution created even more lucrative opportunities for the guild, enabling them to upgrade their facilities, weapons, and equipment. With these advancements, the Ashen Shadow Society began taking on increasingly high-profile and high-stakes contracts, eventually reaching the formidable level of influence they wield today.\nNow, the Ashen Shadow Society operates as a powerful, semi-independent entity that often acts outside the bounds of the law. Though they once worked closely with law enforcement, they now follow their own rules, driven by profit above all else. Membership in the guild is highly exclusive, and only the most skilled and disciplined individuals are granted full status. Those who fail to meet their standards or fall out of favor are relegated to the “Support Squads”—a derisive term for teams assigned the most dangerous and thankless tasks, often serving as expendable assets for the higher-ranking members.\nThe guild’s primary goal has always been, and remains, the pursuit of wealth. “Money” to the Ashen Shadow Society isn’t just gold; it can also mean powerful magical items, influence, or eliminating obstacles to their profit margins. While they do not kill indiscriminately, they are mercenaries in the truest sense, willing to take any job—so long as the price is right. True to their chaotic neutral alignment, they are a dangerous and unpredictable force in Stickyickistan, a group guided by ambition and the allure of gold.\nHierarchy\nWithin the clandestine world of the Ashen Shadow Society, a complex hierarchy governs the inner workings of the organization. Divided into squads and driven by internal competition, this system ensures power dynamics and control within the elite bounty hunter clan. Here is an overview of the hierarchy, where groups of four hold significant influence:\nThe Council of Shadows:\nAt the pinnacle of power lies the Council of Shadows, composed of four highly influential figures within the Ashen Shadow Society. These individuals are the true leaders, pulling the strings from the shadows and determining the clan’s overarching objectives. Their identities remain closely guarded secrets known by the Enigmatic Quartet, including Zara Blackthorn. The Council wields immense authority, making decisions that shape the destiny of the organization.\nThe Enigmatic Quartet:\nDirectly beneath the Council of Shadows is the Enigmatic Quartet, a group of four renowned and enigmatic assassins who serve as the council’s primary advisors. Each member possesses distinct skills and expertise, representing different facets of the clan’s operations. The Enigmatic Quartet holds significant sway within the Ashen Shadow Society, their influence extending to strategic decision-making, resource allocation, and the execution of critical missions. They are known for their elusive nature, rarely seen in public and shrouded in mystery.\nThe Squad Hierarchy:\nWithin the Ashen Shadow Society, squads of bounty hunters form the backbone of the organization. These squads consist of four highly skilled individuals who work together to complete missions and bring in lucrative bounties. Each squad operates with its own internal hierarchy, determined by the squad members themselves. The more money a squad brings in, the higher their status and privileges within the Ashen Shadow Society.\nSquad Ranks:\na) Novices:\nNovices are newly formed squads within the Ashen Shadow Society. They are comprised of bounty hunters who have recently joined forces and are still establishing their reputation. Novice squads are eager to prove themselves and climb the ranks of the organization. They undertake smaller missions and lower-paying bounties as they build their experience and teamwork.\nb) Bloodhounds:\nBloodhound squads have proven their mettle by successfully completing several mid-level missions and consistently bringing in substantial amounts of money. Their exceptional tracking skills and resourcefulness make them formidable adversaries. As Bloodhounds, these squads gain more recognition within the organization, earning access to higher-paying and more challenging contracts.\nc) Ravens:\nRaven squads have established themselves as elite units within the Ashen Shadow Society. Their expertise, experience, and track record of high-value bounties set them apart from the rest. Ravens excel in both stealth and combat, making them versatile and highly sought after for specialized missions. Their accomplishments grant them respect and influence among their peers.\nd) Shadowsong:\nShadowsong squads are the pinnacle of success within the Ashen Shadow Society. They are legendary in their skill, notoriety, and the wealth they bring in. Shadowsong squads have mastered the art of bounty hunting, their prowess unmatched by any other unit. They operate with precision, efficiency, and lethal effectiveness. Shadowsong squads are entrusted with the most dangerous and lucrative missions, and their successes are celebrated throughout the organization.\nSquad Competition and Rewards:\nSquads within the Ashen Shadow Society compete fiercely to bring in the largest sums of money. The more successful a squad is in completing high-value contracts, the more missions they are entrusted with, leading to greater opportunities for wealth and advancement. A squad’s rank determines their cut of the earnings, allowing higher-ranked squads to enjoy a larger share of the bounty.\nAs squads rise through the ranks, they gain access to better resources, equipment, and support from the organization. They also gain recognition and influence among their peers, solidifying their position within the Ashen Shadow Society.\nIt is through this dynamic hierarchy that squads of bounty hunters strive to ascend and establish their reputation, ultimately aiming to catch the attention of The Enigmatic Quartet and the Council of Shadows, the ultimate arbiters of power within the organization.\nSupport Squad:\nThe support characters are recruits that have shown they don’t have what it takes to be on an actual ASS bounty hunting squad, but they can still be useful. Since they are recruits, they have seen the inside of the citadel, therefore if they don’t survive they can’t tell any tales."},"Factions/Ashen-Shadow-Society/Squads/Unit-BH-Umbra-Δ9":{"title":"Unit BH-Umbra Δ9","links":["Factions/Ashen-Shadow-Society/Ashen-Shadow-Society","Regions/Bobo-Bush-Estates","NPC's/Hazeus-Tokenheim","Arcannabis-Extraction","Indicus-Sativalin","Regions/Upper-South-Booftown","Weknas-Grasscheeks","Factions/Cough-City-Crew","Cough-City-Thugs","NPC's/Grimjaw","Whisper","Vex","POI's/Ashen-Citadel","NPC's/Zara-Blackthorn","Gilded-Nug","NPC's/Wes-Scantlin","Regions/The-Outback","Fungi","Regions/Gapejaw-Bog","Wraith","NPC's/Arcana-Belle","POI's/The-Green-Grimoire","Baeriggs-Bigbreath","POI's/Puffer's-Pottery","Factions/The-Plague-Plugz","Xon","Factions/The-Norfies","Factions/Tribunal-Highblade-Coalition/Tribunal-Highblade-Coalition","Factions/Tribunal-Highblade-Coalition/Squads/Dusk-Flame-VII"],"tags":[],"content":"This is a squad of Ashen Shadow Society Bloodhound rank bounty hunters.\nLore\nArcannabis Colossus\nThis unlikely group of misfits came from humble standing in the guild and society as a whole. As a Novice squad they were sent to Bobo Bush Estates to investigate an abandoned botanical garden that locals said had been taken over by some kind of plant horror. They arrived and exterminated an Arcannabis Colossus to the surprise of the guild who thought it was certain they would die.\nPot Potion Press Pilfer\nAfter that they were hired through the guild by a man named Hazeus Tokenheim to recover an item that had been stolen from his Arcannabis Extraction factory. Hazeus was certain that one of his smaller competitors, Indicus Sativalin, had a hand in stealing the machine, but he couldn’t be sure he acted alone. The squad went to the factory to investigate the scene of the crime. Here they were able to gain some critical info that the heist would have been much too difficult for one man to do alone, but that was all. Next they decided to try and get in contact with an informant through the guilds sources. They headed to Upper South Booftown to meet a shady individual known as Weknas Grasscheeks, a low time member of the Cough City Crew that agreed to snitch on the gang for money. Weknas was waiting for the squad in an empty lot in front of a strip club, and bodega. Before they were able to get any info out of Weknas they were spotted by some Cough City Thugs, and a fight broke out over Weknas’ apparent snitching. The thugs were defeated, and Weknas revealed the involvement of high ranking Cough City Crew members in the heist of the Arcannabis Extraction machine. They were paid by Indicus to steal the machine, and to protect him while he attempted to reverse engineer it and make the schematics public. Weknas’ final word before sprinting away into the dark alleyways, was that the Machine was taken to Indicus’ secret lab in the forgotten sewer system. The squad used this information to find an entrance to the forgotten sewers where they encountered Indicus’ hired security who they swiftly dealt with. Once inside they snuck past more security, and some alchemists in a magitech hydroponics operation. Just past the hydroponics is where Grimjaw, a Cough City Crew member was sitting. They snuck past him too, and into the main alchemy lab where Indicus was speaking with two other high ranking Cough City Crew members named Whisper, and Vex. The squad was able to hide until Whisper and Vex left the room momentarily, then they confronted Indicus by surprise. Indicus desperately tried to explain his motive to the squad. He explained that Hazeus has had an illegal monopoly on the Arcannabis Extraction market for years, and he has been using his immense wealth, and political cronies to manipulate the laws in his favor. He wanted to expose Hazeus’ corruption, and make the extraction machine available to all in Stickyickistan. It was then that Grimjaw, Whisper, and Vex all re-entered the room. Xon was able to recognize Grimjaw from a description and a wanted poster with a 5000gp reward they saw at the Ashen Citadel. Quickly Xon made the executive decision for the squad to abandon the original bounty, take Indicus’ side against Hazeus, and instead claim the bounty on Grimjaw’s head. A fight ensued, and the squad stood victorious. They took Indicus’ word for future work, and chased in the bounty on Grimjaw. When Hazeus got word of the betrayal, he sent a strongly worded letter to Zara Blackthorn threatening to put a bounty on the squad.\nThe Gilded Nug\nAfter spending some of their money from the bounty they did get, they were sent on their most dangerous mission yet. This mission was not about the money, but about a legendary artifact that the guild has been after for years called the Gilded Nug. The guild had already sent a different squad on a mission to steal it from a Cough City Crew member who had it at the time. While they were undercover as Cough City Crew members, they were able to get close to the member in possession of the Gilded Nug, but one fateful night, the trap house they were hiding out in was broken into. An infamously disgraced singer and bard, Wes Scantlin, from a well known rock band of the realm called Puddle of Mudd, came to take the Gilded Nug for his own nefarious purposes. The Gilded Nug was stolen, but the undercover squad was able to follow Wes to his lair in The Outback. They were led to a place known as Gapejaw Bog where they lost sight of Wes. They reported back to Zara who then relayed this info to Unit BH-Umbra Δ9. They set out into the Outback with a poorly drawn map that the undercover squad made for them. On the trail they faced a few tough fights, and ended up losing Fungi in the forest. The rest of the squad carried on with the mission, and eventually made it to Gapejaw Bog where they narrowly avoided Wes’ magical traps, and spectral defenders. Once in the main cavern, they heard the sounds of Puddle of Mudd being played by Wes. He was jamming on his lyre as the squad snuck up on him. As Wraith closed the distance Wes sensed his presence at the last moment, and went invisible. Wes tried to run away while assuming he was unseen, but Wraith’s blindsight ability allowed him to catch Wes and deliver a stunning strike. This proved to be too much for the infamous bard, and he was cut down before getting to fight back, or explain himself. After Wes fell dead, a magical portcullis dissipated behind him to reveal the Gilded Nug in a glass case. the squad retrieved the Nug, exited the cave, and were extracted by Zara Blackthorn on an airship.\nBugs &amp; Bloodhounds\nThey were taken back to the Ashen Citadel where they received their reward for completing the mission, and reunited with Fungi who was infested with bugs. Zara explained their new Bloodhound rank status to them and gave them all an A.S.S Sending Stone. She them recommended that they get Fungi fixed up right away, and gave them the address of a healer by the name of Arcana Belle. Zara also notified the squad that their quarters are being upgraded, so they would be unavailable for a few hours. Finally she also lets them know that because of Fungi’s failure on the last mission, the whole squad would have to complete a combat training exercise before they would be allowed to take on more guild work. The squad left Zara’s office and went downtown to go shopping. On the way to The Green Grimoire, Wraith and Baeriggs Bigbreath were able to spot some thieves can’t on the sign of a pottery shop called Puffer’s Pottery, and the man behind the counter was a bit too hairy. The thieves can’t read “Poison Shop”, so they went in. They discreetly made it apparent they were not there for pottery, and they were instructed to go behind a curtain and down some stairs in pairs of two. In the basement they met a wererat named Rikki Tweeks, and other members of their gang called The Plague Plugz. They bought some poison, and got an offer to collect some Giant Centipede venom for Rikki at a price of 100gp per vial of venom. While walking around downtown, they noticed an odd couple that seemed to be following them. A tall blonde woman in a flower dress with a sigil adorned staff, and a red dragonborn wearing immaculate armor with a sword at his waist. The squad ducked into an alleyway, and Wraith made an illusion of a brick wall behind them. The duo looked into the alley from across the street, and teleported away. Xon saw them one more time as they approached the Ashen Citadel. This time they were much further away, and just standing watching instead of following. When the squad finally returned from their shopping trip they began the combat training exercise.\nMembers\n\nWraith\nXon\nBaeriggs Bigbreath\nFungi\n\nAllies\n\nThe Plague Plugz\nIndicus Sativalin\nWeknas Grasscheeks\nZara Blackthorn\nThe Norfies\n\nEnemies\n\nHazeus Tokenheim\nCough City Crew\nTribunal Highblade Coalition\nDusk Flame VII\n"},"Factions/Ashenfey":{"title":"Ashenfey","links":["Deities/The-Three-Sisters/Shadash","Ashen-Elves"],"tags":[],"content":"Like her sister, Shadash created her own realm. To differentiate it from her sister’s realm, Shadash blended strong threads of negative energy into the weave of the world, thus creating an inherent necrotic taint.\nTo populate her new realm, Shadash coerced neutral and evil fey to join her. She also forcibly transported humanoids, plants, and animals. These transplants faced the harsh challenge of adapting or dying. While many perished, some survived and a few even thrived. A group of elves, the Ashen Elves, created a civilization within the Ashenfey, although this later fell due to treachery and corruption. Most of the realm’s inhabitants are evil, and the others tend to be hard-hearted survivors. Visitors to this realm can expect, at best, cruel indifference.\nThe Ashenfey resembles the natural material world but can be best described as having a profound darkness and harshness. Plants have more and sharper thorns, venom and disease are more intense, colors are more subdued, animals are more savage, the rivers are often sluggish and flow with tainted water, and so on. Because the Ashenfey is infused with negative energy and weak in positive energy, all living creatures in the Ashenfey gain “resistance” to healing and necrotic vulnerability. If a creature is normally vulnerable to necrotic damage, that vulnerability remains. If a creature is normally resistant to necrotic damage, it loses that resistance (but does not gain vulnerability). Creatures normally immune to necrotic damage become resistant while in the Ashenfey. Undead creatures find the negative energy of the Ashenfey pleasant and stimulating. Whenever they make an attack roll or a saving throw, they roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.\nAn odd feature of the Ashenfey is that it contains no native silver ore; instead, it has necrotic iron. This metal can be worked like iron, though it is somewhat heavier. Necrotic iron brought into the Verdanfey grows uncomfortably warm and emits sparks of shadow. Material plane silver brought to the Ashenfey grows slightly warm and erratically emits faint sparks, as if the realm were trying to reject it. Fey silver brought to the Ashenfey grows uncomfortably hot and emits bright sparks. Many creatures of the Ashenfey find silver to be unpleasant, and to some, it is toxic. Inhabitants of the Ashenfey often refer to the material plane as the “Silverlands,” usually in a derisive manner.\nWhile the Ashenfey is a distinct plane, it is coextensive with parts of the material plane. Because of this, the Ashenfey and material plane resemble each other, though there are significant differences. For example, a healthy material plane river is likely to have an Ashenfey counterpart, but this counterpart is likely to be a smaller river with foul water and a sluggish current. There are numerous weak spots in the barrier between the realms that permit intentional and accidental travel between them. These spots are often important to druids, and some are marked with special trees or rings of standing stones—often to warn the unwary of the danger. The opening of such gateways is often marked with a strange weather event, such as a lightning storm with oddly colored lightning and harsher-than-normal thunder. Certain good beings watch for these signs, standing on guard against what might emerge from the Ashenfey."},"Factions/Cough-City-Crew":{"title":"Cough City Crew","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Backstory\nIn the bustling city streets of Stickyickistan, a notorious street gang known as the Cough City Crew held sway over the criminal underbelly. The origins of this infamous gang can be traced back to a time when economic disparities and societal inequalities plagued the city-state.\nStickyickistan, with its booming Arcannabis industry and vast wealth, had created a stark contrast between the opulent elite and the struggling lower classes. It was within the marginalized neighborhoods, where poverty and desperation reigned, that the seeds of the Cough City Crew were sown.\nThe gang’s formation can be attributed to four charismatic and street-smart individuals who shared a common bond of hardship and disillusionment. They were known as the “Founding Four,” and their names echoed through the city as whispers of fear and rebellion: Rocco “Ratjaw” Moreno, Maxine “Viper” Diaz, Ezra “Slick” Evans, and Tara “Torch” Sanchez.\nThe Founding Four, each with their unique set of skills, came together with a shared vision—to reclaim power and control over their lives. They witnessed the exploitation and corruption that ran rampant in Stickyickistan and vowed to forge a path of their own, built on loyalty, camaraderie, and the pursuit of a more equitable society.\nThe name “Cough City Crew” emerged from the squalid conditions of the gang’s early days. The neighborhoods they called home were known for their suffocating pollution and smog, which perpetually lingered in the air, causing bouts of coughing among its residents. It was in these polluted streets that the crew found strength, resilience, and their determination to rise above their circumstances.\nWith their charismatic leadership, the Cough City Crew quickly gained a reputation for their audacity, resourcefulness, and ruthless tactics. They carved out territories within the city, establishing themselves as a force to be reckoned with, challenging the oppressive rule of the wealthy elite.\nThe crew’s activities ranged from illicit drug trade and smuggling to extortion and organized heists, targeting the symbols of opulence that taunted the impoverished masses. Yet, they weren’t solely driven by criminal enterprises. Beneath the surface, the Cough City Crew harbored a desire to bring attention to the plight of the marginalized, to disrupt the status quo, and to dismantle the barriers that kept the lower classes oppressed.\nTheir actions garnered attention from both law enforcement and rival gangs, leading to fierce turf wars and intense power struggles. The Cough City Crew, however, proved to be a resilient force, adapting to ever-changing circumstances, and always finding new ways to defy their adversaries.\nWithin the gang’s hierarchy, the Founding Four retained their status as the ultimate decision-makers, shaping the crew’s strategies and objectives. Beneath them, a network of lieutenants and enforcers ensured the gang’s operations ran smoothly, while foot soldiers proved their loyalty through acts of violence and unwavering allegiance.\nDespite their reputation for criminal activities, the Cough City Crew held a certain twisted sense of honor within their ranks. They abided by an unwritten code, protecting their own and defending their territories with ferocity. They became a symbol of resistance for the disenfranchised, a beacon of hope for those who felt trapped in the merciless grip of inequality.\nThe story of the Cough City Crew continues to unfold, interwoven with the tumultuous history of Stickyickistan.

Booftown, predominantly populated by the native halflings who had long suffered under the influence of the human settlers, became the breeding ground for this fierce and brutal gang.\nMOB’s origins can be traced back to a time of deep resentment and seething anger within Booftown. The halfling population had endured years of oppression, their rights trampled upon by the dominating human settlers who controlled the city. As the divide between the haves and the have-nots grew wider, a group of halfling individuals decided it was time to take matters into their own hands.\nLed by four charismatic and ruthless figures, MOB rose to prominence as the voice of the marginalized halfling community. The leaders, known by their street names, were Jinx “Razorblade” Willowbark, Felix “Brawler” Thornfoot, Lexi “Scarlet” Bramblethorn, and Remy “Torchlight” Goldleaf. Each of them brought their unique skills and ferocity to the forefront, earning their positions as the key figures within the gang.\nUnlike their rival, the Cough City Crew, MOB emphasized brutality and intimidation over finesse and strategy. They earned a reputation for their ruthless tactics, leaving a trail of violence and chaos in their wake. Their methods were often crude, employing fear and sheer force to establish dominance within their territories.\nThe name “Mandem on Booftown” reflected their close-knit unity and loyalty to their native district. “Mandem” was a term used by halflings to refer to a tight-knit group of friends or associates, emphasizing the bond that united the gang members. Booftown, despite its oppressive conditions, was their home, and MOB was determined to make their mark within it.\nMOB’s activities included extortion, racketeering, and brutal acts of violence against rival gangs and those who opposed their rule. They targeted the symbols of human affluence and authority, seeking to dismantle the structures that had oppressed their community for far too long. They operated with a blatant disregard for the law, viewing themselves as the enforcers of their own brand of justice.\nWithin the gang’s hierarchy, the four leaders remained at the top, overseeing the gang’s operations and ensuring their message of rebellion reverberated throughout Booftown.

They were a force to be reckoned with, unleashing their fury upon any who dared to cross their path.\nAs the rivalry between MOB and the Cough City Crew intensified, the streets of Stickyickistan became a battleground for power and control. The clashes between the two gangs were marked by bloodshed and devastation, leaving a lasting impact on the city and its inhabitants.\nMOB’s legacy would forever be intertwined with the struggle for justice and liberation within Booftown.

Rather than fight, they elected to share influence over the material realm. Darana, embodying neutrality, was pleased with the balance between her sisters. While her sisters accepted this compromise, each desired to shape a realm in accord with their own conception of ethics. To this end, Ashalla created a plane parallel to that of the material realm and imbued it with strong positive energy.\nTo populate her new realm, Ashalla invited good and neutral fey to join her. She also extended an invitation to elves, gnomes, and even some dwarves and humans. As for the plants and animals, she either imported them or created them as needed. While many of the inhabitants of the realm are good, not all are. The influence of Ashalla does mean that few evil creatures dwell permanently in the realm, so peaceful visitors will rarely face anything more threatening than cruel pranks.\nThe Verdanfey resembles the natural material world but can be best described as having a stronger living presence: plants and animals are more robust, colors are more vivid, water is clearer, and so on. Because the Verdanfey is infused with positive energy, all living creatures in the Verdanfey gain “vulnerability” to healing and necrotic resistance. If a creature is normally vulnerable to necrotic damage, that vulnerability is suppressed in the Verdanfey. If a creature is normally resistant to necrotic damage, it becomes immune while in the Verdanfey. Undead creatures find the powerful positive energy of the Verdanfey unpleasant and disruptive. Whenever they make an attack roll or a saving throw, they must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.\nAn odd feature of the Verdanfey is that it contains no native iron ore; instead, it has fey silver. This metal can be worked like iron, though it is lighter. Material plane iron brought to the Verdanfey grows slightly warm and erratically emits faint sparks, as if the realm were trying to reject it. Many creatures of the Verdanfey find cold iron to be unpleasant, and to some, it is toxic. Inhabitants of the Verdanfey often refer to the material plane as the “Ironlands,” sometimes in a derisive manner.\nWhile the Verdanfey is a distinct plane, it is coextensive with parts of the material plane. Because of this, the Verdanfey and material plane often resemble each other, albeit with some important differences. For example, a material plane river is likely to have a Verdanfey counterpart, but this counterpart is likely to be a larger river with cleaner water and a faster current. There are numerous weak spots in the barrier between the realms that allow intentional and accidental travel between them. These spots are often important to druids, and some are marked with special trees or rings of standing stones. The opening of such gateways is often marked with a strange weather event, such as a lightning storm with oddly colored lightning and strangely musical thunder. Certain evil beings watch for these storms, eager to intrude into the Verdanfey."},"Factions/Zooka-Mire-Collective":{"title":"Zooka Mire Collective","links":["Golgari-Swarm","Regions/The-Outback","Regions/Zooka-Mire","Stickyickistan","Species/Halflings","Fester-Von-Zaaza","The-Rotwake","Zaazarin","Mortispora","Gutterhive","NPC's/Sibrek-Hollowspore"],"tags":[],"content":"A small breakaway sect of the Golgari Swarm that has found their way to Stickyickistan, and inhabit a swampy region of The Outback just outside city limits known as Zooka Mire.\n\nThe Zooka Mire Collective is the guild that fuses the opposite values of life and death, fostering growth in Stickyickistan’s decaying communities but also fostering decay in places of growth.\nThe Halflings, zombies, insects, and undead-plant hybrids of Zooka Mire are like one massive, growing, feeding organism, collectively spreading across the land wherever it can fit.\nThe Zooka Mire Collective provide a necessary service in Stickyickistan, in that they dispose of the carcasses, and magitech waste that civilization leaves behind, and mysteriously they also provide sustenance for the forgotten and the downtrodden.\nThey are the scavengers and decomposers at the fringes of the food chain, but yearn to be the predator at the top.\nThe collective is organized more like a single organism than a typical guild: it has a nucleus or nerve center that drives the direction and growth of the collective; elements that collect nutrients and convert them into usable resources; defenses that resist and fight off foreign bodies; and an instinctual drive to survive, reproduce, and overcome.\nThe Zooka Mire Guild Master is currently Fester Von Zaaza an undead necromancer who managed to revive himself after death.\nFester maintains a council of shamans, arcanists, and rogues called The Rotwake.

This kind of volcano can occur naturally when certain conditions are met, and the island now known as Stickyickistan is right in the goldilocks zone for this to happen. An Arcanite Cone often belches up Arcanite from the depths of the planet into the crater at the peak of the mountain. Dwarf miners are often employed to venture into the rim of the crater, and extract large amounts of Arcanite which is then used to power the city’s Magitech grid, enchant items, and exported to other elsewhere in the realm.

Virgin Seeds are wild seeds that have been procured from The Outback, and need to be enchanted before they can be planted, or they grow non-magical cannabis. The amount of time the plant takes to fully mature is 1d6+5 weeks in game time.\nEnchantment\nTo enchant seeds the PC needs proficiency in Alchemist’s Supplies, all of the components required to cast the spell they want to enchant the seed with, and the ability to cast the spell themselves, or a scroll of the spell. Using the Alchemist’s Supplies all materials are combined, and expended. This creates one enchanted seed. The pollen from an enchanted Arcannabis plant can be used on the plant that sprouts from a virgin seed. Doing this pollinates the virgin plant with enchanted seeds. Using pollen from non-magical cannabis will annul any enchantment the mother plant had if any. Using Feminized pollen means the seeds from the pollinated plant can only produce a female plant, and adopts the spell of the plant the pollen came from.\nBiological Sex\nBy default there is a 45% (1 - 45 on d100) chance a seed will be male, 45% (46 - 90 on d100) chance it will be female, and a 10% (91 - 100 on d100) chance of a hermaphrodite. You can make or buy, and apply an alchemical solution to the plant that will guarantee the gender to be female, and a solution that makes any plant herm. Male plants produce pollen, female plants produce the actual enchanted flowers that are smoked, and a hermaphrodite will produce both. A female plant grows 1d4+1 uses of the spell it is enchanted with, unless it gets pollinated, or dies. If a female plant is pollinated it produces 1d8+2 seeds, but no flowers. A male plant produces enough pollen upon harvesting to pollinate 1d6+6 female plants.

Elemental Trees have an unintended defense mechanism: when damaged, they emit a burst of their energy type. The damage is normally 1d6 and the DC for the saving throw is 10. This can be adjusted for the tree size or its “power” as desired. Elemental Trees are immune to their own energy type. Some energy trees have an unusual degree of awareness and will react proactively to perceived threats. These trees have 60 ft tremor sense and can attack a target within 30 feet—this uses the same damage and saving throw as the normal mechanics. Radiant trees can detect the presence of undead creatures within 30 feet and will always attack them with their radiant energy. Necrotic trees can detect the presence of living creatures within 30 feet and will always attack non-plants within that range.

But their use in crafting is not without risk.\nThe simplest version of these optional crafting rules is to apply them only to wands that cast a\nsingle spell that does energy damage corresponding to an energy tree. Alternatively, the rules could apply to any wooden item that can cast a spell doing the right sort of damage, such as a staff of fire or a staff of power. If the spells all have the same damage type, then the benefits would apply to all the spells. If the spells have different damage types (or do not do damage)\nthen the benefits would only apply to the energy type corresponding to the wood used. This could be simplified by allowing multiple types of wood to be used in an item so the benefit would apply to all damaging energy spells. Crafting with this material is not without danger and risk. Each hour spent crafting an item with this wood inflicts 1d6 damage of the appropriate energy type on the crafter. For the sake of simplicity, apply the damage at the end of each hour. The crafter must also make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to properly utilize the wood. If the roll fails, roll on the failure table.

Led by a dwarven war lord, who they crowned their king, named Thordal “Three-Chins” Stonemug, the dwarven colonists attempted to start a nation of their own. They were eventually overtaken by the sheer ingenuity of the humans from Stickyickistan that had been expanding much more rapidly than Bongstad.

Here, they’ve mastered the arts of smuggling, subterfuge, and survival, making them indispensable to the city’s underworld.\nThough many halflings live honest lives as shopkeepers, brewers, and traders, a significant number are involved in illicit operations, including black-market enchantments, poison sales, and high-stakes gambling rings. The Mandem on Booftown (MOB) is the most infamous of these groups—a halfling-exclusive gang that controls much of The Ashtray’s backstreets, specializing in contraband Arcannabis strains and exotic poisons.\nDespite their criminal reputation, halflings are fiercely communal, sticking together in tight-knit families and extended kin networks. Whether sharing a meal, a smoke, or a scheme, they pride themselves on loyalty—but cross one, and you’ll find out just how good a halfling can be at making problems disappear.\nFaith in The Three Sisters\nBefore colonization, the halflings of Stickyickistan were deeply connected to the Three Sisters, the goddesses who personify nature’s balance between good, neutrality, and destruction.

This bustling metropolis, inhabited by approximately 27 million denizens, thrives as a tightly woven tapestry of terraced dwellings. At the heart of it all lies the Capitol building, perched upon Nevercough Island, an idyllic smaller landmass embraced by an inlet on the main island.\nAscending from the base of the volcano, the upscale residences extend into the lush jungle, offering breathtaking vistas that stretch out to the majestic ocean. The colossal canopy of tropical trees, reminiscent of gargantuan redwoods, provides a natural shield, safeguarding inhabitants from the perilous potential of volcanic eruptions. In stark contrast, the slums that cling to the mountainside exude an aroma of brimstone and sulfur, perpetually shrouded in an ethereal haze of ash and smoke, reminiscent of the favelas of Brazil. These settlements wind their way upward, nearly reaching the rim of the crater in certain areas. Above the slums, an industrial district clings to the rim and delves deeper into the crater, thriving amidst the volcanic terrain.\nThe centerpiece of this mesmerizing landscape, affectionately known to the locals as Mount Zooka, is a unique marvel—a type of volcano called an Arcanite Cone. These particular cones rise above rich Arcanite deposits, their imposing forms resembling vast mounds of ebony volcanic rock. Near the base, dark, sluggish lava courses through the terrain, surrounding the volcano, while at its zenith, a massive crater brims with bubbling magma. During eruptions, projectiles ranging from golf ball-sized to soccer ball-sized volcanic rocks, globules of molten magma, and occasionally, chunks of Arcanite, burst forth from the crater. After each eruption, the valuable ores, minerals, and particularly the Arcanite, are harvested from the crater. Arcanite, a raw magical element typically found deep within the earth, can be extracted and purified, granting magical properties to weapons and armor. To facilitate this process, the government of Stickyickistan, aka the Nevercough Tribunal, has established makeshift mines and outposts within and around the crater, providing shelter for workers during their resource-gathering shifts.\nThe island’s soil boasts copious amounts of nutrients, enriched by high traces of Arcanite. Consequently, the surrounding flora and fauna flourish with extraordinary fertility and magical essence. This mystical essence imbues the forest creatures, vegetation, and sometimes city dwellers, with potent magic. Dabnar Nevercough, the esteemed Chief Magistrate, assumes the mantle of both head of state and Supreme Judge, governing over the realm of Stickyickistan. While Arcannabis stands as the city-state’s primary export, considerable profits are also garnered from the trade and sale of Arcanite and other natural resources. Notably, since the arrival of human colonists, alcohol has been outlawed within the region due to its perceived threat to the Arcannabis market. Consequently, Zooka Malt, a beverage derived from Arcannabis buds, has emerged as the main alternative to traditional ale, presenting a diverse array of Arcannabis-infused concoctions for the denizens to indulge in. Nevercough Island serves as a haven for high-end establishments, housing exclusive shops vending exquisite goods, a courthouse, a museum, a fine art gallery, and esteemed libraries, among other cultural landmarks.\nSouth of Nevercough Island, and north of the volcano, lies an area known as Lower South Booftown—affectionately referred to as Booftown. This middle-class district paints a tranquil suburban picture with its small, family-owned shops and public parks. A constant flow of thick, dark, and slow-moving lava serves as a natural boundary, separating Lower South Booftown from its northern counterpart, aptly named Upper South Booftown or “The Ashtray” due to its gritty nature. The Ashtray harbors the city’s darker underbelly and plays host to some of the realm’s most notorious gangs. Among them, the MOB (Mandem on Booftown) and the CCC (Cough City Crew) dominate the landscape, engaging in relentless clashes over territorial disputes, control of illicit substances, weapons, arcane artifacts, and monetary gains. Upper South Booftown primarily houses the native Halfling population, alongside other minority groups. MOB remains an exclusively Halfling gang, while the CCC boasts a more diverse membership, encompassing various races, including Halflings, Humans, and other groups.\nTo the east of the volcano lies Bobo Bush Estates, a realm where opulent mansions and lavish villas serve as the abodes for influential figures from Stickyickistan. North of Nevercough Island, the region of North Booftown thrives as the agricultural heartland of Stickyickistan. This area also harbors a Human criminal enterprise known as The Norfies, specializing in extortion, gambling, and the illicit distribution of bootleg alcohol. They cleverly employ a bookmaking business as a front for money laundering and maintain ownership of the North Booftown Downs, a renowned horse race track. The Norfies have faced accusations of engaging in illegal gambling and manipulating race outcomes. There is also a Dwarven settlement Dug into the base of Mount Zooka on the west side of the city called Bongstad. The Dwarves have cleverly engineered a magical geothermal power generation system that powers a majority of the Magitech grid in the realm. Some of the best forges on the island can be found in this part of town.\nBeyond the confines of the city lies what the residents of Stickyickistan call The Outback, a colossal expanse of arcane forests, swamps, bogs, mountain ranges, jungle, rainforest, beaches, and a small area of badlands and desert at the southern end. The Outback is inhabited by creatures from all over the material plane and beyond. Due to the naturally high levels of pure magic spewed from Mount Zooka, the island has been a hotspot in the multiverse.\nPast Stickyickistan\nIn the annals of the multiverse, nestled amidst the turbulent seas, there exists an island now known as Stickyickistan. This extraordinary place, with its vibrant tapestry of cultures and bountiful resources, has a captivating history that intertwines the rise of its economy with the clash of two diverse civilizations.\nLong ago, the few, and only humanoid creatures on the island were a tranquil and harmonious community of halflings. They had a polytheistic faith in The Three Sisters, lived in harmony with the land, and all the other creatures in it, cherishing the bountiful gifts bestowed upon them by the arcane nature of the island. The island flourished, its soil fertile and its forests teeming with life. But fate had other plans in store.\nIn a wave of Human Colonialism, ambitious settlers arrived upon the shores of Stickyickistan. Eager to claim the island’s vast wealth for their own, they viewed the halflings as obstacles to their ambitions. Driven by greed and a desire to control the land’s resources, the humans launched a forceful invasion, shattering the serenity that once enveloped the island.\nAmidst the chaos and conflict, the halflings valiantly resisted. Yet, outnumbered and outmatched, their hopes for victory dwindled. Recognizing the desperate situation, their wise leaders made a fateful decision—a negotiation for survival. A pact was struck, granting the halflings a protected enclave within the city-state and acknowledging their rights to partake in the newfound prosperity.\nAs the human settlers sought to establish dominion over the land, they discovered a remarkable resource—an extraordinary plant they called Arcannabis. Its magical properties became the foundation of Stickyickistan’s economy, revolutionizing trade and transforming the island into a hub of prosperity. The potent properties of Arcannabis, when harnessed, granted individuals heightened senses, expanded magical abilities, and even visions into realms unseen.\nArcannabis Cultivation quickly became a specialized art, passed down from generation to generation. Vast fields of the magical marijuana stretched across the landscape, tended to by expert cultivators who nurtured the plants with care and reverence. The city-state’s wealth soared as merchants flocked from distant lands to partake in the arcane wonders Stickyickistan had to offer.\nUnderneath the bustling trade and enchanting haze, however, lay the remnants of a fractured society. The divide between the human settlers and the halfling community remained palpable, their coexistence marred by lingering distrust and cultural clashes. Nevertheless, as the economy thrived, the city-state’s leaders endeavored to bridge the gaps and foster unity among its diverse inhabitants.\nOver time, a unique blend of cultures emerged in Stickyickistan. The fusion of halfling traditions and human innovations birthed a captivating tapestry of art, music, and cuisine. Festivals celebrating both the halflings’ reverence for nature and the humans’ entrepreneurial spirit became the heartbeat of the city-state, uniting the population under a shared sense of identity. This is not to say that all racial tensions have gone away.\nStickyickistan, with its majestic architecture, aromatic markets, and vibrant streets, stands today as a testament to the resilience and adaptability of its people. The island’s history, forever marked by the invasion and subsequent coexistence, serves as a reminder of the complexities of cultural exchange and the potential for harmony amidst disparate communities.\nAs the waves lap against the shores of Stickyickistan, the echoes of its past reverberate through the bustling city streets. The legacy of the halflings’ ancestral connection to the land and the humans’ quest for prosperity interweave to form the fabric of this remarkable island city-state, forever entwined with the enigmatic allure of Arcanite."},"index":{"title":"Welcome to Stickyickistan","links":["Sources/Eberron","Sources/Ravnica","Sources/Dragonlance","Stickyickistan","Regions/The-Outback"],"tags":[],"content":"Welcome to Stickyickistan\nStickyickistan is my homebrewed D&amp;D world, a melting pot of various settings blended into one expansive and ever-evolving universe.
