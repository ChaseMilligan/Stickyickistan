Velindra Ashveil can give them information about this location for 100gp, alternatively they may come across it while travelling in the Grim Forest through The Outback. Just off the main road through the Grim Forest is a hidden path that can be seen with a DC 16 Perception check. This path leads to the ruins of an abandoned castle from before Human Colonialism. These ruins are now inhabited by a cult of Halflings that worship Shadash (Acolytes of Shadash). They believe they have a spiritual connection to the castle, and their ancestors who they claim once inhabited it. If the PC’s inspect the castle walls, there are verses etched into the stone walls above doorways, and an altar that clearly show those who built the castle venerated Shadash. A DC 13 Religion check will allow the PC more info about Shadash if they know nothing. The acolytes do not take kindly to outsiders especially if they aren’t Halflings, and will not hesitate to strike. There are six acolytes at the castle, and they are using the basement of the castle to store:\n\n133gp\n2 rubies worth ~25gp\n1 diamond worth ~100gp\n278sp\n507cp\nand a bunch of handmade jewelry adorning symbols of Shadash worth ~0.\n\nThe acolytes can be reasoned with, and just want to be left alone to rebuild the castle, but they do plan on spreading death and decay in the surrounding area."}}
