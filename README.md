# Welcome to Stickyickistan

Stickyickistan is my homebrewed D&D world, a melting pot of various settings blended into one expansive and ever-evolving universe. Intentional ambiguity allows the world to function as an open sandbox, giving both my players and me, as the DM, the freedom to explore limitless possibilities without rigid constraints.

This world draws inspiration from multiple established settings, including the Forgotten Realms, Eberron, Ravnica, Dragonlance, and Spelljammer, with each faction and influence uniquely flavored to fit the distinct tone of Stickyickistan. It tries to weaves together elements of medieval fantasy, cyberpunk, and steampunk, creating a rich and often chaotic world where magic, technology, and intrigue collide—sometimes in ways that defy logic, but that's part of the fun.

At the heart of the setting lies the sprawling metropolis of Stickyickistan, a city teeming with adventure, mystery, and danger. Whether navigating the city's labyrinthine alleyways, dealing with powerful guilds and shadowy organizations, or uncovering lost relics of forgotten civilizations, adventurers will find no shortage of opportunities. Beyond the city stretches The Outback, a wild and unpredictable frontier filled with untamed magic, forgotten ruins, and lawless territories waiting to be explored.
