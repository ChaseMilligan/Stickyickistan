# Backstory

## Fungi, the Forgotten Construct

Fungi has no memory of his origins. His first recollections are a haze of decay and darkness, the air thick with the scent of rot. Then, he was running—his legs carrying him blindly through the vast, moonlit expanse of [[The Outback]]. When he blacked out, he awoke in a clearing, surrounded by a perfect ring of button mushrooms. His body, covered in a silk-like white mycelial structure, bore small fruiting bodies sprouting from his form. He had no idea where he was—or even who he was.

For a time, Fungi wandered the wilderness, drawn to the quiet wisdom of nature. He studied the mushrooms, lichen, and molds that thrived in the Outback, feeling an inexplicable kinship with them. The forest became both his sanctuary and his teacher, guiding him in ways no mentor could. He discovered that the world respected him as he respected it, and in time, his knowledge of the natural world allowed him to tap into primal magics, manifesting druidic abilities that helped him survive.

One day, while walking through the dense brush, he stumbled upon something foreign—a cobbled path. Unlike the soft forest floor, it was devoid of life, its cold, hard stones suffocating under his feet. Curious, he followed it, instinctively spreading small filaments of his own mycelium into the cracks between the bricks. The road led him to a place unlike anything he had ever seen—the sprawling city of Stickyickistan.

The city overwhelmed him at first. Towering structures stretched toward the sky, and people moved in endless currents, oblivious to his presence. He avoided the city’s heart, instead lingering at its fringes, finding solace in abandoned places and neglected spaces. A hemp paper processing plant became a reliable source of sustenance, its discarded fibers providing nourishment. Farmers often spotted him at the edges of pastures, carefully collecting cow patties to cultivate the fungal strains he found most fascinating.

As he honed his druidic skills in this strange new world, the [[Ashen Shadow Society]] (A.S.S.) took notice of him. The guild’s scrying systems caught glimpses of his unique form, and their interest was piqued. They had seen constructs before—[[Warforged]] were not unheard of—but none like him. Fungi was something else, something new.

A novice squad was dispatched to make contact. Fungi, distrustful and wary, resisted at first. However, when one of the operatives presented him with a small stone covered in a rainbow lichen, he was immediately captivated. He took the stone into his hands, admiring the intricate symbiosis of life upon it. It was enough to calm him, and he agreed to accompany them to the Citadel.

Once within the city’s heart, he was studied and assessed. His biology was unlike anything the guild had encountered before. They ran tests, probed his fungal structure, and recorded his reactions. A week later, [[Zara Blackthorn]] introduced him to his new squad. He was no longer just a wanderer—he was part of something. But even as he settled into his new life, his past remained a void, a missing piece he could not grasp.
## The Truth Beneath the Mire

Fungi’s true origins lie deep beneath the swampy expanse of [[Zooka Mire]], at the base of [[Mount Zooka]]. [[The Mycotic Forge]], a hidden laboratory of decay and rebirth, was the birthplace of his kind. It was here that the infamous [[Sibrek Hollowspore]], an Artificer Mycotyrant of the [[Zooka Mire Collective]], attempted his most ambitious project yet: the creation of a sentient fungal warforged.

Sibrek was once a disgraced biomancer of the [[Arkanitech Guild]], cast out for his obsessive pursuit of necrotic [[Magitech]]. He found refuge among the [[Golgari Swarm]] splinter-faction, where his heretical experiments were welcomed. In the Mycotic Forge, he crafted the [[Mycoforged]], resurrecting discarded warforged husks by binding them with mycelial networks and necromantic energy. His ultimate goal was the Sporeborne Legion, an undying army of fungal constructs that would spread his will across the land.

Fungi was meant to be the first of this new breed—a living weapon, a fungal horror engineered to command the Mycoforged. But Sibrek made a mistake. He gave his creation a mind, one that yearned not for conquest, but for understanding. Fungi did not see the world as his master did; he did not hunger for decay or domination. He sought knowledge, connection, something more than the cold purpose Sibrek had designed for him.

To Sibrek, this was an unforgivable flaw.

Disgusted with his failure, Sibrek abandoned the project, scrapping it before it could progress. But Fungi would not simply fade away. He saw the suffering of his brethren—the mindless constructs, shackled to their creator’s will. He could not accept it. He would not accept it.

A rebellion was born in the dark recesses of the Mycotic Forge. Fungi, fueled by newfound defiance, convinced the lesser Mycoforged to rise up against their creator. But they were no match for Sibrek. The rebellion was crushed, the dissenters slaughtered, their bodies repurposed as mere spare parts for future experiments.

Fungi barely escaped with his life. Sibrek struck him down as he fled, his final blow severing something deep within him—his memory, his past, his sense of self. The fungal warforged stumbled into the darkness, his mind shattered, his body weak. And so he ran. Ran through the night. Ran through the Outback. Ran until he could remember nothing but the scent of decay and a room of darkness.

Now, unknowingly walking a path that may one day lead him back to the Mycotic Forge, Fungi stands at a crossroads. He has found acceptance within the Ashen Shadow Society, but questions still linger in the recesses of his mind. Who was he? Where did he come from? And why does the name Sibrek Hollowspore stir something deep within his bones—a whisper of hatred, of sorrow, of something lost?

One day, he will remember.

And when he does, he will return.
