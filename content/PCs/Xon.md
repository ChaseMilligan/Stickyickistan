# Backstory

pragmatic

The town was small, the kind of place where one’s business was everybody else’s. Suzi was just another kid trying to blend in—until that hot, crowded afternoon in the town square. A bully, sharp-tongued and cruel, picked her out. The taunts turned to shoves, and when the crowd gathered, Suzi’s body betrayed her. Her face twisted, blurred, and re-formed, suddenly mirroring the bully’s smirk.

Gasps became shouts. Monster. Stones flew. People Suzi had trusted, who’d smiled at her yesterday, now looked at her with murder in their eyes. She ran, blood dripping, lungs burning, past the gates that slammed shut behind her.

That was the day Suzi died—and Nix was born, forged in the hate of a town too small to understand.

From that day on, Nix wandered the open road, lost and adrift, until the journey led to a city where they began practicing the art of shape changing. It wasn’t long before they caught the eye of a reclusive older gnome, an investigator with a drinking problem named [[Zook]]. The gnome was hired to look into a series of odd circumstances: petty crimes with seemingly innocent people being accused, but no one could figure out the truth. When the gnome discovered that Nix’s ability was the cause—turning into others and unknowingly leaving confusion in their wake—he decided to take Nix under his care. He taught them the art of observation, deduction, and deception. Life with the mentor was a mix of late-night lessons, cryptic advice, and long silences, often interrupted by the gnome’s drinking.

When the gnome passed away, Nix found themselves living as him for a time, not out of necessity, but out of a deep desire to honor their mentor’s legacy. It wasn’t a burden; it was a chance to continue his work. Eventually, Nix left, boarding a ship to [[Stickyickistan]], their next chapter unfolding.

Still under the guise of their late boozy mentor, [[Zook]], Nix found work in [[North Booftown]] with [[House Northbourne]], a gang that distributed illicit alcohol among other nefarious dealings. Using alchemical knowledge, Nix transformed alcohol into a wax-like substance, which was then sold at a bookstore as candles. The laboratory was located deep under a cemetery, accessed through one of the mausoleums. The pay was not great, nor were the working conditions, but it suited Nix’s needs, even as they grappled with their mentor’s dependence on alcohol, which had become their own. One late night while crafting, an enraged spirit descended upon the workshop, furious over the disturbances near its resting place. Hurling beakers, solvents, burners, and any other objects in the room with the power of its shattered psyche, it eventually tossed Nix—slamming them into a wall near the staircase that led back to the surface. As Nix was getting back up, one of the burners that had been thrown ignited a nearby barrel of liquor. The resulting explosion engulfed the underground facility in flames, costing Nix their right arm.

It was many days before Nix woke in a nearby church, bandaged and drained of energy. Gone was Zook’s face—staring back at them in a basin of water was the image of their childhood bully, a late-teenage human girl. A local had found them unconscious near the mausoleum entrance in that form, assuming it to be their true identity. Weakened and disoriented, Nix remained at the church for weeks, regaining their strength. When asked their name, they gave the best answer they could think of—Xon. Not the bully’s name, but close enough, a placeholder for yet another life.

As their body recovered, they discovered something else had changed. The calamity had done more than take their arm—it had awakened something within them. Nix could now manipulate blood in unnatural ways, altering their own flow and pressure at will, even igniting exposed blood into flame. Worse still, they could reach into the veins of others, disrupting their bodies in ways they barely understood. Whatever they had become, it was something new. Something dangerous.
