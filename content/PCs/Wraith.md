#Alive 

Currently a 1st rank [[Ashen Shadow Society]] bounty hunter. The 1st rank are known as Bloodhounds. Their squad's name is [[Unit BH-Umbra Î”9]].
# Backstory

An advanced [[Warforged]] creation of The Ashen Shadow Society, Wraith was designed as a stealth combat oriented drone. When tasks were given to high prestige squads that needed a fill in or just simple fodder, he was put forward. While Wraith was a capable fighter and could hold his own, he was usually in over his head, struggling to survive the chaos. This molded Wraith into a violent machine with impulsive tendencies. As acting fast was akin to survival, he now often acts first without properly surveying the situation. After several of these missions with close calls and near death experiences Wraith began to revel in the risk, danger, and violence. These violent "quirks" can be seen both in combat and in downtime, and are generally seen as a negative by those around him. After six months of being sent into deadly scenarios and managing to survive, Wraith was given the opportunity to join into a newly formed low ranking squad of the A.S.S. While no formal leader was chosen, he immediately labeled [[Xon]] as the leader. As Wraith had only been told what to do previously, leading anyone else was a completely foreign concept. He now is dipshit buddies with [[Baeriggs Bigbreath]] and has a deep seated hatred for [[Fungi]], seeing the construct as a coward and a freak (ironically).

# Personality Traits 
- Socially unaware/awkward, unaware of this fact 
- Opportunist, will be open to trying new things. In his short lifespan has not done many different things, as he had little free will till recently. 
- I want to play him somewhat like a impulsive kid with issues, childlike amazement at new things, self control problems, temperamental, etc. 
- Violent -Strong bonds with party members, probably values them more than they value him. Will not admit to this fact 
- Aspirations to rise in ranks to the level of those that used him as fodder ( I haven't decided if he would be against or for the constructs as affordable losses, he enjoys the fight now, but as a newly created blank slate I would think he was fearful of his role) 
- Has a distrust/fear of other constructs, bad at reading them

# Goals
- **Short-Term**: Wraith remains loyal to orders and focused on accumulating wealth, using his skills to climb the ranks and establish his influence.
- **Long-Term**: Once he gains enough power and status, Wraith will seek retribution against those who once treated him as expendable, ensuring they pay for using him as bait.
