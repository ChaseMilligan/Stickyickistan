### **The Grim Forest: Nature’s Forgotten Graveyard**  

Once a thriving woodland, the Grim Forest is now a twisted, overgrown expanse of cursed trees, rogue [[Magitech]], and things that should have died long ago. It was here that the [[Emerald Blight]] consumed the war-torn city of [[Spliffholm]], turning its people into rotting, fungal-infested undead. leaving behind their cursed legacy in the [[Ruins of Spliffholm]]. The only thing keeping the plague contained is a barrier of Radiant [[Elemental Trees]], planted by desperate native [[Halflings]] druids, [[Ashenfey]], [[Verdanfey]], and arcanists from other cities in Spliffholm’s final days.  

Now, the Grim Forest is a place of eerie silence, where withered treants stalk intruders, long-forgotten war machines patrol abandoned roads, the Blighted Ones whisper from the shadows, waiting to spread their infection once more. Few dare to enter, and even fewer return—at least, not as themselves.

There is also an open [[Ashenfey Gate]] to [[The Ashenfey]] and [[Verdanfey Gate]] to [[The Verdanfey]] in the Grim Forest. Creatures from these fey-touched dimensions roam the Grim Forest between the gates hunting each other trying to destroy the other faction's gate to the prime material dimension.
