A bustling Island trade hub in the [[Ocean]] known for its towering spires and labyrinthine canals, Ravensport thrives on commerce, secrecy, and opportunity. Merchant ships from across the seas dock here to exchange fine silks, rare spices, and exotic artifacts. However, beneath its gilded façade, the city is rife with smugglers, spies, and cutthroats. The [[Blackfeather Consortium]], a powerful merchant guild with shadowy dealings, controls much of the port’s economy—and its underworld. Those who cross them rarely live to regret it.
