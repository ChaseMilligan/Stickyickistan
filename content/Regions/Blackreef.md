A desolate and foreboding [[Ocean]] island, Blackreef is named for the jagged obsidian-like rocks that encircle its shores, wrecking unwary ships. The island is largely uninhabited, save for old ruins and hidden coves used by pirates and exiles. Rumors speak of haunted shipwrecks beneath its waters and strange lights flickering along the cliffs at night. Sailors fear the eerie silence that blankets the island, calling it a place of ill omensâ€”though for those with no fear of curses, it serves as the perfect place for clandestine dealings and disappearances.
