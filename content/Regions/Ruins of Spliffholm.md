### **The Rise and Fall of Spliffholm**

Once a booming [[Magitech]] lumber fortress, [[Spliffholm]] was the industrial heart of [[Stickyickistan]], famous for its [[Arcanite]]-infused trees used in [[Elemental Vehicles]], siege engines, and enchanted weaponry. Originally founded by the dwarven artificer [[Draza Zharrah]], the city's experimental forestry produced [[Elemental Trees]], making it a military and economic powerhouse.

But power breeds greed. Spliffholm’s ruling guilds fought over resources, trade routes, and arcane secrets, plunging the city into a brutal magitech civil war. Factories became battlegrounds, rogue golems rampaged through the streets, and desperate warlocks summoned fiends, undead, and unstable reality-warping magic. The final blow came when the necromancer [[Valmorra the Hollowed]] unleashed the [[Emerald Blight]], a magical plague that turned the city’s population into rotting, fungal-infested undead.

In a last-ditch effort, an alliance of native [[Halflings]] druids, [[Ashenfey]], [[Verdanfey]], Elemental creatures, and arcanists from other cities sealed the ruins behind a barrier of Radiant [[Elemental Trees]], whose divine-infused wood keeps the undead trapped to this day. Now, Spliffholm lies buried within the [[Grim Forest]], a cursed, overgrown ruin teeming with rogue war machines, vengeful treants, and mindless [[Blighted Ones]].

Adventurers whisper of untouched treasures and lost magitech secrets within the ruins, but **few return to tell the tale—and those who do never stop coughing.**
