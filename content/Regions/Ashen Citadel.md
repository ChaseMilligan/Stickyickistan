Towering over the heart of [[Nevercough Island]], The Ashen Citadel serves as the headquarters of the infamous [[Ashen Shadow Society]]—[[Stickyickistan]]’s most feared and powerful bounty hunting guild. A fortress of dark stone, reinforced [[Magitech]] barriers, and arcane wards, the citadel is both a command center and a fortress, standing as a silent reminder that no one escapes the reach of the A.S.S.

The citadel’s lower levels house a [[Combat Training Facility]], forges, an info laboratory and holding cells where captured targets await their fate. Further in, strategists and hunters review high-profile contracts, coordinating their efforts to track down fugitives, rogue mages, and anyone whose capture or elimination pays the right price. The upper levels, shrouded in secrecy, are rumored to contain war rooms, enchanted archives, and private chambers for the Society’s highest-ranking members.

Few outsiders are permitted inside the Ashen Citadel, and even fewer leave without either a contract in hand or a bounty on their head. In the heart of Stickyickistan’s capital, it is the one place where even the most powerful fear to tread—unless, of course, they come with gold to spend and a name to cross off.
