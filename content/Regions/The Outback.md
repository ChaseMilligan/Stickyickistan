Beyond the sprawling cityscape of [[Stickyickistan]] lies The Outback, a vast and untamed and largely unexplored wilderness of many biomes where civilization fades and nature takes hold. A dense, tangled expanse of towering [[Arcanite]]-infused trees, hidden rivers, and ancient ruins, it is a land of hermits, cults, and creatures from all over the multiverse.

The Outback is home to those who reject city life, whether by choice or necessity. Exiled criminals, rogue druids, and forgotten warlocks carve out lives in the wild, while strange communes and doomsday cults worship the land’s raw, untapped magic. The deeper one ventures, the more dangerous it becomes—feral beasts, wandering spirits, and ancient arcane anomalies lurk beyond the jungle’s edge, waiting for foolish trespassers.

Few dare to brave The Outback’s uncharted depths, but for bounty hunters, smugglers, and treasure seekers, its mysteries offer the promise of lost knowledge, untapped power, and fortunes waiting to be claimed—if they can survive long enough to take them.
