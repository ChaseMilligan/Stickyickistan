## The Ashtray

Upper South Booftown, better known as "The Ashtray", is where the streets are rough, the air is thick with soot, and the law only exists if you can enforce it yourself. Wedged between the slow-churning lava flows of [[Mount Zooka]] and the more "civilized" parts of the city, this is a place where the strong thrive, the weak disappear, and everyone learns to hustle.

The native halfling population makes up a significant portion of The Ashtray’s residents, though the district is home to a chaotic mix of outcasts, criminals, and those who simply don’t fit in anywhere else. Here, the [[Mandem on Booftown]] (MOB) and the [[Cough City Crew]] (CCC) fight an endless turf war over control of illicit [[Arcannabis]] strains, underground fight rings, and black-market [[Magitech]].

Buildings climb over one another in a tangled mess of shoddy construction, creating multi-layered alleyways where anything can happen—and usually does. Hidden apothecaries peddle rare poisons, backroom taverns serve bootlegged [[Alcohol]], and bounty hunters stalk their marks through the smog-choked streets.

Despite its lawless reputation, Upper South Booftown isn’t just a den of crime—it’s a proving ground. Here, fortunes are made and lost in a single dice roll, gangsters rule like kings, and even the smallest [[Halflings]] can rise to power—if they’re ruthless enough.
