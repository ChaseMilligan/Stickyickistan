- [[Molten Maw]], is a colossal underground volcanic city in the [[Underdark]] inhabited mainly by [[Duergar]] and [[Svirfneblin]], that serves as both a natural forge and a deadly hazard.
- Rivers of semi-intelligent, magically charged lava course through the tunnels, sometimes forming elemental creatures that guard the flows.
- Criminals and rebels on the surface sometimes flee to Molten Maw, surviving in its hidden smuggler dens and fire-resistant cave networks.
- Thus, Molten Maw is the heart of a literal underground criminal market known as [[The Silt Road]].
