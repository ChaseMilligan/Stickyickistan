### **The [[Elemental Trees]] of Stickyickistan and the Fall of Spliffholm**

#### The Creation of Elemental Trees

In the ever-evolving magitech landscape of Stickyickistan, innovation often comes at a dangerous cost. Centuries ago, the legendary artificer [[Draza Zharrah]], a [[Dwarf]] master of [[Bongstad]], sought to push the boundaries of arcane craftsmanship. Dissatisfied with the limitations of traditional materials, she studied the arcane-infused flora of [[Verdanfey]] and [[Ashenfey]], two Fey-touched dimensions teeming with extreme magical energies.

Inspired, she sought to grow trees infused with elemental forces, believing that wood shaped by the primal energies of fire, lightning, and void would yield unparalleled arcane foci and weapons. Through decades of trial and error, Elemental Trees were born—living conduits of elemental magic, capable of producing staffs, wands, and magitech components that could channel magic like never before.

However, when experimenting with psychic energy, the trees developed intelligence. Unwilling to use sentient beings as raw materials, Draza abandoned this line of research, and soon after, the first Treants of Stickyickistan began to appear. Some scholars argue that these creatures were simply awakened by exposure to [[Arcanite]] —others claim they were the trees’ way of fighting back.
#### The Rise and Fall of Spliffholm

Draza’s discoveries attracted power-hungry mages, warlords, and industrialists, leading to the rise of Spliffholm, a booming fortress-city built around magitech forestry, elemental harvesting, and siegecraft innovation. The powerful trees grown here were used in warships, siege engines, and devastating magitech weaponry that would shape the course of Stickyickistan’s expansion.

At its height, Spliffholm rivaled [[Nevercough Island]] itself, producing magically enhanced warships, towering arcane ballistae, and golem-infused war machines. Its ruling merchant houses grew arrogant and greedy, hoarding wealth and exploiting forced labor, particularly from native [[Halflings]] and minor elemental creatures.

But magic, greed, and unchecked ambition are a volatile mix.
#### The Arcane Civil War and the Cataclysm

As power struggles erupted among mages, priests, and mercenary factions, the city fell into civil war. Industrial sabotage, magical duels, and full-scale battles tore the city apart, with factions summoning fiends, creating unstable war golems, and using necromantic plagues to gain the upper hand.

At the peak of the conflict, the Necromancer [[Valmorra the Hollowed]] unleashed her ultimate weapon—the Emerald Blight, a magical plague that turned the living into mindless, fungal-infested undead. While her intent was to control the fallen, the Blight quickly spiraled out of control, transforming Spliffholm into a nightmarish wasteland of rotting, deathless horrors.

Realizing the catastrophe would consume all of Stickyickistan, an unlikely alliance of native Halfling druids, Ashenfey, Verdanfey, Elemental creatures, and arcanists from the other cities —some of whom had been enslaved in Spliffholm’s industrial mills—banded together to seal the undead within the ruins. They planted a barrier of Radiant Trees around the city, whose divine-infused wood burns away the Blight. To this day, the trees grow unchecked, keeping the cursed ruins locked away.
#### The [[Grim Forest]] and the Forgotten Horrors

Now, the [[Ruins of Spliffholm]] lie deep within the Grim Forest, a twisted land where the boundaries between life and death blur. The Radiant Trees still stand, holding the Emerald Blight and its endless undead legions at bay, but the deeper one ventures into the ruins, the more unstable magic becomes.

Treants, once protectors, now stalk the land with vengeful purpose, ensuring that no one disturbs the cursed city. Ancient automatons, rogue magitech constructs, horrific experimental plant life, and forgotten war beasts still roam, remnants of the industrial nightmare that once ruled here. The [[Blighted Ones]]—undead that have evolved within the Emerald Blight—whisper in the shadows, yearning to spread their disease beyond the walls of their prison.

Few venture into The Grim Forest, and fewer still return. But forbidden artifacts, lost treasures, and knowledge long buried still linger within the ruins. And for those reckless enough to seek the power of Spliffholm, the forest is always watching.
