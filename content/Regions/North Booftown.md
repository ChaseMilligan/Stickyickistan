North Booftown is [[Stickyickistan]]’s agricultural heartland, a sprawling region of lush, magically-enhanced farmland responsible for much of the city-state’s food production—and more importantly, its [[Arcannabis]] exports. Thanks to the volcanic soil rich in [[Arcanite]]-infused nutrients, crops here grow larger, faster, and stronger, making North Booftown the backbone of the Arcannabis trade that fuels Stickyickistan’s economy.

Despite its picturesque rolling fields and rustic charm, North Booftown is far from peaceful. It’s the domain of [[The Norfies]], a well-connected human criminal enterprise that controls much of the gambling, bootleg alcohol, and underground racing circuits in the region. Their prized asset? [[The North Booftown Downs]], a high-stakes horse track that serves as both a legitimate business and a front for money laundering, rigged races, and backroom deals.

While the wealthy landowners and farming guilds uphold the image of honest labor and rural prosperity, the reality is a cutthroat world of sabotage, bribery, and territorial disputes between Arcannabis producers, smugglers, and enforcers. Step onto the wrong farmstead at the wrong time, and you might find yourself fertilizer.
