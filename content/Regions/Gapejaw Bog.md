Gapejaw Bog is a region of [[The Outback]] with a cave mouth at the center shaped like the jaws of an ancient beast. A winding path between giant mangrove trees leads to the center of the bog where the gaping jaw of an ancient beast dares anyone strong enough to enter. This cave has been used by cults, and criminals since time immemorial as a hideout or treasure trove. Most recently it was used by [[Wes Scantlin]] as a hideout and a place to store a magical artifact he stole known as the [[Gilded Nug]].
