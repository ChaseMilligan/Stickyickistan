Situated at the center of [[Stickyickistan]]’s capital, Nevercough Island is the seat of power, wealth, and intrigue. A small yet densely packed landmass nestled within the [[Percolat Inlet]], it is home to the city-state’s ruling elite, high-end merchants, and the most influential institutions. While the rest of Stickyickistan pulses with chaos, Nevercough Island presents a facade of sophistication, order, and wealth—but beneath its pristine streets, the city’s true power struggles unfold.

At its heart stands the [[Capitol Building]], where Chief Magistrate [[Dabnar Nevercough]] rules with an iron grip, his courts dispensing both justice and corruption in equal measure. Surrounding the Capitol are lavish high-rise apartments, private clubs, and institutions of knowledge, including [[The Grand Arcanum Library]], the [[Nevercough Museum]], and elite magical academies. High-end boutiques, apothecaries, and specialty [[Magitech]] shops cater to the upper class, selling rare artifacts, custom enchantments, and goods most citizens could never dream of affording.

For those with gold, influence, or ambition, Nevercough Island is a paradise and a battlefield in one. For everyone else, it is a world just out of reach—unless they’re willing to take it by force.
