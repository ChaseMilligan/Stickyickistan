**Race**: [[Orc]]

**Rank**: 1

**Renown**: 8

**Personality**: Gruff and no-nonsense. Kezrin values results over niceties and has little patience for talkers or show-offs. Despite this, they have a soft spot for underdogs.

**Backstory**: Kezrin was part of a full squad of four, but on a botched job, his fellow squad members perished. Right now he has found himself between squads. As an accomplished operative, Kezrin has proved he is too valuable of an asset to be sent down to the Support Squad, so he has been spending his days roving from tavern, to casino, to brothel, to bed, and back again while he waits to be assigned to a new squad. This means work has been non-existent for him for the last little while, and he needs some help making a little dosh.

**Encounter**: Kezrin can be found drinking and smoking away his last few pieces of silver and gold at [[The Rusted Chalice]] any time of day. If the party approaches him, he will explain his situation to them, and will ask for them to take pity on him and help with a small bounty. It would be dangerous for him to do solo, and he has little to offer them in return, but it would be a great help to him in getting back on his feet. He has been tasked by a shady group, that he won’t name as they have asked for anonymity from him, to go into [[The Outback]] for a [[Giant Centipede Hunt]] to collect venom for brewing poison.

**Result**: The party will not receive gold or payment of any kind, but Kezrin will let them in on a secret. Thanks for the help with that. You know I said I didn’t have anything for ya, but fuck it. I’ll let you in on a little something. He will then look both ways to make sure no one is watching or listening. He then leans in even closer, and quietly says “[[Puffer's Pottery]] Downtown”. He then gives them a wink, and heads off.
