**Race**: [[Tiefling]]

**Rank**: 1

**Renown**: 3

**Personality**: Charismatic and cunning, Velindra has a flair for the dramatic. Sheâ€™s prone to exaggeration and loves spinning tales of her (sometimes questionable) exploits.

**Encounter**: Velindra can be found at [[The Rusted Chalice]] in the evenings. She enjoys playing blackjack, and will be friendly if PC's decide to play with her. She also might happen to approach them, whatever feels right. Velindra has some info about an [[Abandoned Castle Ruins]] in [[The Outback]]. She will hype this place up a lot saying that it seemed like a free raid with just a few [[Goblins]] hanging around, and a load of loot. She describes some pathetic looking creatures guarding a hoard of gold coins and other items that one would expect from a Dragon. She says that if they give her 50gp she will be willing to spill the beans on where it is. If questioned, she will say she was alone when she came upon it, so she left cause it didn't look that easy, but with a friend or two it seemed like a piece of cake. Giant piles of gold coins and gems, she will say. A DC 17 Insight check will reveal this to mostly be a lie. She does indeed know of an abandoned castle in the Outback guarded by small creatures, but the amount of wealth they have has been wildly exaggerated, and the creatures guarding it may or may not be Goblins.
