Fizzlebud is a mildly arcane variant of cannabis that causes carbonation-like fizzing when steeped, and feelings of euphoria, disorientation, and lowered inhibitions when imbibed. Often used in experimental [[Magitech]] fermentation. While it is commonly believed to be a variety of [[Arcannabis]], it is actually a completely different species according to botanists of [[Stickyickistan]], although it is very closely related.
