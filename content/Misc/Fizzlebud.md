Fizzlebud is a mildly arcane variant of cannabis that causes carbonation-like fizzing when steeped, and feelings of euphoria, disorientation, and lowered inhibitions when imbibed in any way. Often used in experimental [[Magitech]] fermentation, and the brewing of [[Zooka Malt]]. While it is commonly believed to be a variety of [[Arcannabis]], it is actually a completely different species according to botanists of [[Stickyickistan]], although it is very closely related.

Fizzlebud can also be smoked. This is the most commonly found variety of [[Arcannabis]] enjoyed by all citizens when drank or smoked. The effects of smoking and drinking Fizzlebud is the same.
