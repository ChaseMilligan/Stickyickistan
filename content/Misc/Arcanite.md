Arcanite is the solid material element form of weave magic. Arcanite is incredibly rare in the multiverse, but not so much in [[Stickyickistan]]. High traces of this raw magical element can be found throughout the soil on the island, and [[Mount Zooka]] is a specific kind of volcano known as an Arcanite Cone. This kind of volcano can occur naturally when certain conditions are met, and the island now known as Stickyickistan is right in the goldilocks zone for this to happen. An Arcanite Cone often belches up Arcanite from the depths of the planet into the crater at the peak of the mountain. [[Dwarf]] miners are often employed to venture into the rim of the crater, and extract large amounts of Arcanite which is then used to power the city's [[Magitech]] grid, enchant items, and exported to other elsewhere in the realm. Arcanite is the driving force behind the high-magic of Stickyickistan. Some [[Halflings]] with ancestry native to the island have been slightly altered by the Arcanite rich environment giving them some innate arcane skills.
