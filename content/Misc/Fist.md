## Playing

A big and small blind will be identified by using d20 rolls. Highest in roll is small blind, and the next highest is big blind. Ante won’t scale throughout the game for simplicity sake. Minimum buy in is 50gp, maximum is 500gp. SB pays 1gp, and BB pays 2gp to start the pot, then everyone rolls 2d6 to themselves (and GM). Based on these rolls the players can take the normal poker actions of call, raise, fold. After all pre-flop actions are taken the house dealer rolls the 3d6 flop, and the game progresses as a normal poker game would with players connecting a 5d6 “Fist” with their 2d6 and 3d6 from the board. Fists are as follows from highest to lowest:
