The magebred animals are generally bred to create better animals that are more suited for daily life. Some experiments in magebreeding have led to new magical beasts with surprising intelligence, and supernatural or spell-like abilities. The vast majority of magebred animals in [[Stickyickistan]] originate in the stables of House Northbourne's estate in [[North Booftown]]. Some magebred animals have escaped into the wild, where they become ill-tempered and territorial.
