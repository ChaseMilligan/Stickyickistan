In [[Stickyickistan]], Magitech is the lifeblood of progress, industry, and warfare—a volatile fusion of arcane energy and mechanical ingenuity that has propelled the city-state into a new era of power and excess. Fueled by [[Arcanite]], the rare magical ore harvested from [[Mount Zooka]], Magitech ranges from simple enchanted tools to experimental war machines, reshaping daily life and the balance of power.

The city's greatest minds—the [[Arkanitech Guild]], rogue artificers, and criminal syndicates—compete to push Magitech further, creating clockwork constructs, arcane firearms, and reality-warping enchantments that blur the line between magic and machinery. The wealthy elite on [[Nevercough Island]] flaunt their personal teleportation sigils and self-mending garments, while the slums of [[Upper South Booftown]] repurpose discarded Magitech scraps into makeshift weapons and illicit contraptions.

But Magitech is as unstable as it is revolutionary. Faulty enchantments lead to catastrophic explosions, experimental constructs gain sentience and go rogue, and overloaded Arcanite batteries have turned entire neighborhoods into ashes. Despite the risks, Stickyickistan’s hunger for innovation and power ensures that Magitech will only continue to evolve—for better or worse.
