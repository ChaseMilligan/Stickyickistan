Zooka Malt is a beverage similar to ale that is made from a special variety of [[Arcannabis]] called [[Fizzlebud]]. The effects of drinking Zooka Malt are the same as smoking Fizzlebud. Similar to what you would experience if you drank a beer and smoked a joint.

### Brewing

Requires proficiency in Alchemist's Supplies, a standard size barrel, and at least a quarter pound (96 uses) of [[Fizzlebud]]. Filling the barrel with water, a quarter pound of Fizzlebud, and alchemist supplies, then letting it steep for at least a week will result in a good batch of Malt. The longer it ages will not affect the end product for 2 years before it goes bad.
