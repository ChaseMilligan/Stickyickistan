Aside from their magical nature caused by the [[Arcanite]] rich soil of [[Stickyickistan]], Elemental Trees are the same as normal trees. Being wood, they have AC 15 (as per the object rules) and are plants. Hit points range from 1 (sapling) to 100+ (gigantic tree). Elemental Trees have an unintended defense mechanism: when damaged, they emit a burst of their energy type. The damage is normally 1d6 and the DC for the saving throw is 10. This can be adjusted for the tree size or its “power” as desired. Elemental Trees are immune to their own energy type. Some energy trees have an unusual degree of awareness and will react proactively to perceived threats. These trees have 60 ft tremor sense and can attack a target within 30 feet—this uses the same damage and saving throw as the normal mechanics. Radiant trees can detect the presence of undead creatures within 30 feet and will always attack them with their radiant energy. Necrotic trees can detect the presence of living creatures within 30 feet and will always attack non-plants within that range. The wood from these trees if often used to power different [[Elemental Vehicles]] like airships, and cars.

## CRAFTING WITH ENERGY TREES
While the crafting of magical items usually requires exotic ingredients, using the wood of an
energy tree in the appropriate way can improve an item. But their use in crafting is not without risk.
The simplest version of these optional crafting rules is to apply them only to wands that cast a
single spell that does energy damage corresponding to an energy tree. Alternatively, the rules could apply to any wooden item that can cast a spell doing the right sort of damage, such as a staff of fire or a staff of power. If the spells all have the same damage type, then the benefits would apply to all the spells. If the spells have different damage types (or do not do damage)
then the benefits would only apply to the energy type corresponding to the wood used. This could be simplified by allowing multiple types of wood to be used in an item so the benefit would apply to all damaging energy spells. Crafting with this material is not without danger and risk. Each hour spent crafting an item with this wood inflicts 1d6 damage of the appropriate energy type on the crafter. For the sake of simplicity, apply the damage at the end of each hour. The crafter must also make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to properly utilize the wood. If the roll fails, roll on the failure table. If the roll succeeds, roll on the success table. 
### Failure Table 
Roll d20 
- 1-10 The item is completed but has no special properties. 
- 11-15 The item is ruined but half the value of the materials can be salvaged.
- 16-19 The item is ruined, and all the material is rendered useless and valueless.
- 20 The item explodes. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the item
must make a DC 15 saving throw. A target takes 8d6 damage on a failed save, or half
as much damage on a successful one. See the damage and saving throw table.
