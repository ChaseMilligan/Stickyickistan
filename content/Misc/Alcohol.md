- Alcohol is the most popular, by far, illegal substance in Stickyickistan. 
- Alcohol has been banned by the [[Nevercough Tribunal]] throughout all of [[Stickyickistan]]. This law is not often followed, and many citizens believe it should be legalized. 
- The Tribunal cited the serious health risks related to alcohol consumption as the main reason for the prohibition, but nearly everyone knows that the real reason is because they are "donated" large sums of money from Big [[Arcannabis]]. 
- Large Arcannabis businesses saw alcohol as a threat since very early on in the history of Stickyickistan, and it has become a cultural taboo of sorts. 
- Those who drink alcohol are considered part of a counter-culture, and looked down upon by do-gooders.
- [[The Norfies]] aka [[House Northbourne]], are the largest illicit alcohol distributors in Stickyickistan, running a sophisticated network of secret breweries and smuggling routes. Through layers of obfuscation, and plausible deniability, they employ brewers, alchemists, and mercenaries to produce and transport their contraband, ensuring that Stickyickistan’s thirst for forbidden spirits is always quenched—for the right price.
