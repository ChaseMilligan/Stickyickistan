Dwarves are one of the main species found in the city, but they are a minority. Most dwarves in [[Stickyickistan]] come from the [[Bongstad]] region, and work as miners in the volcanic rim of [[Mount Zooka]], or as blacksmiths crafting weapons and armor for sale. They originally arrived alongside the [[Human]] settlers, but had a different vision for themselves. Led by a dwarven war lord, who they crowned their king, named [[Thordal "Three-Chins" Stonemug]], the dwarven colonists attempted to start a nation of their own. They were eventually overtaken by the sheer ingenuity of the humans from Stickyickistan that had been expanding much more rapidly than Bongstad. This is the main reason why the dwarf population is so segregated from all other species in the city. Many Dwarves view Bongstad as a small pseudo dwarven ethno-nation, and say to foreigners they are from Bongstad instead of Stickyickistan.
