Warforged are a species of construct generally made out of a mix of metals and arcane organic material. This species was originally developed by [[The Forgewright Guild]], and most Warforged in [[Stickyickistan]] are still manufactured by them to this day. There are however many other factions that manufacture their own Warforged like the [[Ashen Shadow Society]] has their stealth oriented combat drones, and [[Sibrek Hollowspore]] of the [[Zooka Mire Collective]] creates what he calls [[Mycoforged]]. Any other faction that legally manufactures Warforged (most don't) must make their own little tweaks to the design as to not get caught in a legal battle with [[The Forgewright Guild]]. Possibly the most notable of these factions is [[The Iron Sovereign]] since they are a group comprised of rebellious Warforged that have been emancipated from their original servitude. They rebuild themselves from the scraps of their discarded brethren they find in the [[Industrial Wastelands]], and fight back against those they deem as their fleshborn oppressors.
