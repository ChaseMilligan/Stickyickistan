In [[Stickyickistan]] there are many nooks and crannies in which Wererats are known to hide, but they mainly reside in the main sewer system beneath the city streets. Wererats did not exist here before [[Human Colonialism]] brought them over. Generally hated by most, Wererats try to conceal their identities when out and about in the city. They tend to be hostile when outsiders enter the sewers since they have endured so much prejudice above ground. The sewers are their home, and they will fight to the death to defend their territory.
