Halflings are one of the main species living in the city, and once were the only humanoid creatures on the island. Halflings in [[Stickyickistan]] are everywhere and nowhere at once—a people both deeply ingrained in the city-state’s fabric and constantly underestimated. While some live simple, semi-rural lives as [[Arcannabis]] farmers in [[North Booftown]], the majority thrive in the dense, labyrinthine slums of [[Upper South Booftown]], also known as The Ashtray. Here, they’ve mastered the arts of smuggling, subterfuge, and survival, making them indispensable to the city’s underworld.

Though many halflings live honest lives as shopkeepers, brewers, and traders, a significant number are involved in illicit operations, including black-market enchantments, poison sales, and high-stakes gambling rings. The [[Mandem on Booftown]] (MOB) is the most infamous of these groups—a halfling-exclusive gang that controls much of The Ashtray’s backstreets, specializing in contraband Arcannabis strains and exotic poisons.

Despite their criminal reputation, halflings are fiercely communal, sticking together in tight-knit families and extended kin networks. Whether sharing a meal, a smoke, or a scheme, they pride themselves on loyalty—but cross one, and you’ll find out just how good a halfling can be at making problems disappear.

### Faith in [[The Three Sisters]]

Before colonization, the halflings of Stickyickistan were deeply connected to the Three Sisters, the goddesses who personify nature’s balance between good, neutrality, and destruction. Many halflings—especially those outside the big city—still worship the Three Sisters in some form.

- **[[Ashalla]], the Green Goddess**
- **[[Darana]], the Blue Goddess**
- **[[Shadash]], the White Goddess**

Though most modern halflings of Stickyickistan follow a mix of practicality and faith, the influence of the Three Sisters is still found in their customs, their magic, and the way they navigate the ever-changing chaos of their homeland.
