The North Booftown Downs is [[Stickyickistan]]’s premier horse racing track, located in the [[North Booftown]] region of the city, is a bustling arena where nobles, merchants, and criminals alike gather to gamble fortunes on enchanted thoroughbreds. By day, it’s a spectacle of speed and sorcery, with horses magically enhanced through selective breeding, [[Arcanite]]-infused feed, and alchemical tonics. By night, the track transforms into a shadowy den of backroom deals, rigged bets, and underground high-stakes gambling.

[[House Northbourne]], a human criminal syndicate, own and operate the Down—at least on paper. In reality, it’s a money-laundering front and a battleground for race-fixing, debt collection, and violent disputes over turf and trade routes. Accusations of enchanted performance enhancers, cursed saddles, and even straight-up hexing rival jockeys are common, but no one dares challenge the results too loudly—at least, not if they value their kneecaps.

Despite its dubious reputation, the Downs remains one of Stickyickistan’s biggest draws, pulling in tourists, thrill-seekers, and crime lords alike. Whether you're here to bet, bribe, or break legs, there’s only one rule at the Downs: the house always wins.
