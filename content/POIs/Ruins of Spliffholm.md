### **The Rise and Fall of Spliffholm**

Once a booming **magitech lumber fortress**, **Spliffholm** was the industrial heart of Stickyickistan, famous for its **Arcanite-infused trees** used in warships, siege engines, and enchanted weaponry. Originally founded by the dwarven artificer **Draza Zharrah**, the city's experimental forestry produced **Ironwood Oaks, Storm Ashes, and Ember Pines**, making it a **military and economic powerhouse**.

But power breeds greed. Spliffholm’s ruling guilds **fought over resources, trade routes, and arcane secrets**, plunging the city into a brutal **magitech civil war**. Factories became battlegrounds, **rogue golems rampaged through the streets**, and desperate warlocks summoned **fiends, undead, and unstable reality-warping magic**. The final blow came when **the necromancer Valmorra the Hollowed** unleashed the **Emerald Blight**, a magical plague that turned the city’s population into **rotting, fungal-infested undead**.

In a last-ditch effort, an alliance of **druids, goblins, and Arcanite treants** sealed the ruins behind a barrier of **Radiant Oaks**, whose divine-infused wood keeps the undead trapped to this day. Now, **Spliffholm lies buried within the Grim Forest**, a **cursed, overgrown ruin teeming with rogue war machines, vengeful treants, and mindless Blightspawn**.

Adventurers whisper of **untouched treasures and lost magitech secrets** within the ruins, but **few return to tell the tale**—and those who do **never stop coughing.**
