Highblade Tower is the [[Tribunal Highblade Coalition]]'s ancestral home, and seat of power. Located downtown on [[Nevercough Island]].
# History

Highblade Tower is nearly as old as [[Stickyickistan]] itself. Over time, it has been expanded significantly, not only to enhance its facilities but also to accommodate the growing private mercenary house.
# Inhabitants

Noble families in the House send their children (namely heirs) to be fostered here, forging life-long bonds with the coalition, and Highblade Tower.

Highblade Tower is also the headquarters of theÂ [[Highblades Guild]]. They return here between assignments or when they have the time.

Despite its size, Highblade Tower cannot hold all of the house's members and hirelings. Thus, they spilled out into [[Stickyickistan]], populating the city with barracks, training facilities, armorers, and weaponsmiths, as well as taverns, to serve the coalition members.
