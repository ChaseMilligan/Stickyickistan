Ravnican Factions Reimagined for Stickyickistan
# Azorius Senate → [[Nevercough Tribunal]]
A bureaucratic, law-enforcing body centered in the Capitol building on Nevercough Island. Known for their rigid, arcane-driven justice system, they draft and enforce the city-state's laws with magitech constructs and enchanted documentation.
# Boros Legion → [[Tribunal Highblade Coalition]]
A militant order of zealots who believe in "righteous combat" to uphold peace and order. Operating from fortified outposts across the city, their glowing magitech weaponry makes them a beacon of hope—or fear.
# Dimir House → [[Ashen Shadow Society]] 
A shadowy network of spies, informants, and assassins who trade in secrets. Their headquarters are rumored to be hidden deep in the industrial underbelly of Mount Zooka, cloaked in magic and subterfuge.
# [[Golgari Swarm]] → [[Zooka Mire Collective]]
A faction thriving in the toxic, nutrient-rich outflows of Mount Zooka. They specialize in recycling and repurposing, using arcane and biological magitech to cultivate powerful alchemical reagents.
# Gruul Clans → The Infernal Reclaimers
A collection of wild, anarchistic tribes living in the Outback and the ruined outskirts of Stickyickistan. They reject magitech development, viewing it as unnatural, and aim to bring the city-state "back to its roots" through violent reclamation.
# Izzet League → [[Arkanitech Guild]]
Inventors, engineers, and researchers who blend arcane magic and technology to push the boundaries of possibility. Their experimental labs are often seen erupting with sparks, explosions, or glowing energy.
# Orzhov Syndicate → The Gilded Covenant
A sinister and opulent financial cartel operating out of Bobo Bush Estates. They blend religion with ruthless economic practices, collecting debts and souls in equal measure through magically enforced contracts.
# Rakdos Cult → The Cinder Masquerade
A chaotic and hedonistic group of performers, criminals, and pyromancers. Their fiery spectacles and bloody rituals captivate—and terrify—audiences throughout Stickyickistan’s underground entertainment districts.
# Selesnya Conclave → The Verdant Kinship
A nature-focused, communal faction located in the jungles around Mount Zooka. They emphasize harmony with Stickyickistan's enchanted flora and fauna, cultivating mystical gardens imbued with Arcanite’s magical essence.
# Simic Combine → The Arcanobiological Consortium
A faction of bioengineers who blend magic, genetics, and magitech to create hybrid creatures and augmentations. Their laboratories in the lower levels of Mount Zooka are teeming with experimental lifeforms.
