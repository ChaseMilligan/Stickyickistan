Dragonlance Factions Reimagined for Stickyickistan
# Knights of Solamnia → The [[Nevercough Tribunal]] Auctoritas Column
A strict order of warriors devoted to honor, justice, and law. Based in fortified bastions on Nevercough Island, they are the city-state’s traditionalists, seeking to maintain order amidst the ever-growing chaos of magitech expansion and criminal power struggles.
# Knights of Neraka (Knights of Takhisis) → The Obsidian Pact
A militaristic faction with a brutal and authoritarian philosophy, enforcing their own version of order through fear and strength. Many of their warriors and enforcers have been enhanced by Arcanite-infused technology, making them a terrifying force.
# The Wizards of High Sorcery → The Arcanum Triune
A mysterious order of spellcasters divided into three sects—White, Gray, and Black—who oversee and regulate magic in Stickyickistan. Their power struggles often determine the direction of magical innovation and influence in the city.
# The Mages of the Black Robes → The Eclipse Cabal
A rogue sect of the Arcanum Triune, operating in the shadows of Mount Zooka’s rim. They pursue magic without ethical restraint, creating dangerous arcane and magitech experiments for their own gain.
# The Mages of the Red Robes → The Umbral Order
A neutral organization of spellcasters and scholars who believe in balance, studying the chaotic fusion of Arcanite and magitech. They work to maintain the equilibrium between progress and destruction in Stickyickistan.
# The Mages of the White Robes → The Celestial Accord
A sect of healers, sages, and defensive mages who use their magic to aid the city-state. They are often aligned with the Argent Sentinels and act as advisors and researchers in the ethical use of magitech.
# The Dragon Armies → The Draconic Syndicates
A network of criminal organizations, each led by a ruthless figure claiming to wield the power of dragons. These syndicates control much of the underground trade in weapons, illicit magitech, and stolen Arcannabis shipments.
# The Seekers → The Hollowed Eye
A faction of radicals who reject the existing power structures and claim to have discovered ancient truths about the origins of Stickyickistan. They operate in secret, infiltrating different organizations to spread their cryptic teachings.
# [[The Legion of Steel]] → [[Ashen Shadow Society]]
# The Church of Paladine → The Radiant Concord
A religious sect devoted to purity, righteousness, and the restoration of divine order in Stickyickistan. They view the rise of unchecked magitech as a corruption of the natural world.
# The Church of Takhisis → The Bloodbound Covenant
A cult-like faction that thrives in Upper South Booftown, worshiping dark forces and profiting from assassinations, underworld deals, and sacrificial magic. Their influence extends into the criminal elite.
# The Cult of Morgion → The Breathless Choir
A secretive cabal of plague-bearers and death-worshippers who believe in the purification of the weak through disease and suffering. They brew deadly toxins, viral magitech plagues, and bioweapons deep in the industrial sectors of Mount Zooka.
