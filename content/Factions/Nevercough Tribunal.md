- Head Magistrate [[Dabnar Nevercough]] rules with his best intentions in mind, and appoints many figures with questionable motives, but none that would question his authority.
- The Tribunal considers itself to be the mediator and controller of all other guilds', and noble houses activities, even though most of its countless decrees are largely ignored. 
- That's not to say the Tribunal is impotent, however—its legitimacy and reach wax and wane over time depending on economics, cultural trends, and the reaction to other guilds' overreach. 
- At its best, the ultra-hierarchical Nevercough Tribunal is just, farsighted, and impartial. At its worst, the guild is cold, stultifying, and bureaucratic.

### The Three Columns.

The _trias politica_ structure of the Nevercough Tribunal has existed nearly since the beginning of [[Stickyickistan]] but had been theoretical and unimportant for millennia. With the ambitions of [[Human Colonialism]] to construct a new civilization, the Tribunal revivified the concept, and it has become deeply meaningful and reflective of the guild's structure and hierarchy.

- **Veridic Column**. Comparable to a judiciary branch, this Column adjudicates, arbitrates, mediates, and studies the effects of Stickyickistanian law.
- **Lexis Column**. This is the legislative part of the guild—the actual makers of law, including assessing the need for new laws and formulating their language.
- **Auctoritas Column**. Putting laws into practice, as well as enforcement of them, is the domain of the Auctoritas Column.
### Roles Within the Nevercough Tribunal

The tribunal's uses of magic tend to fall into three functions: establish, maintain, refine (or alternatively: build, defend, improve). Although these functions might seem to map cleanly to the Columns (Lexis, Auctoritas, and Veridic), all three functions find expression in all three Columns. Examples include:
