House Highblade is an ancient and influential noble family in [[Stickyickistan]], best known for its military legacy and deep ties to the [[Nevercough Tribunal]]. Once a powerful conquering force during [[Human Colonialism]], the house played a pivotal role in subjugating and annexing [[Upper South Booftown]] and [[Lower South Booftown]], securing its place as one of the ruling elite of [[Nevercough Island]]. They hold the second most amount of power of any member in the [[Nevercough Tribunal]].

While they once commanded their own armies, House Highblade has since shifted from direct warfare to strategic influence, overseeing the [[Tribunal Highblade Coalition]] (THC)—a mercenary organization descended from their former military forces. Though the Coalition operates as an independent business, many of its officers and leaders still come from Highblade bloodlines, ensuring the house retains its political and financial grip on the art of war.

Unlike many noble families, House Highblade measures prestige not just in bloodline, but in battlefield prowess, and its members are often trained in warfare, tactics, and diplomacy from birth. They view themselves as the guardians of order and military tradition, using their influence to shape Stickyickistan’s security forces, mercenary contracts, and political conflicts from behind the scenes.
