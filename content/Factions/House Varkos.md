A family of lower nobility with a vast shipping empire, House Varkos is known for its wealth, military prowess, and brutal retaliation against those who cross them. Their emblem is a black wyvern devouring a silver ship, symbolizing their control over the seas and skies of [[Stickyickistan]]. They run [[The Shipwright Guild]] which builds boats and airships, as well as training pilots for both.
