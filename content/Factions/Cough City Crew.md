# Backstory

In the bustling city streets of Stickyickistan, a notorious street gang known as the Cough City Crew held sway over the criminal underbelly. The origins of this infamous gang can be traced back to a time when economic disparities and societal inequalities plagued the city-state.

Stickyickistan, with its booming Arcannabis industry and vast wealth, had created a stark contrast between the opulent elite and the struggling lower classes. It was within the marginalized neighborhoods, where poverty and desperation reigned, that the seeds of the Cough City Crew were sown.

The gang's formation can be attributed to four charismatic and street-smart individuals who shared a common bond of hardship and disillusionment. They were known as the "Founding Four," and their names echoed through the city as whispers of fear and rebellion: Rocco "Ratjaw" Moreno, Maxine "Viper" Diaz, Ezra "Slick" Evans, and Tara "Torch" Sanchez.

The Founding Four, each with their unique set of skills, came together with a shared vision—to reclaim power and control over their lives. They witnessed the exploitation and corruption that ran rampant in Stickyickistan and vowed to forge a path of their own, built on loyalty, camaraderie, and the pursuit of a more equitable society.

The name "Cough City Crew" emerged from the squalid conditions of the gang's early days. The neighborhoods they called home were known for their suffocating pollution and smog, which perpetually lingered in the air, causing bouts of coughing among its residents. It was in these polluted streets that the crew found strength, resilience, and their determination to rise above their circumstances.

With their charismatic leadership, the Cough City Crew quickly gained a reputation for their audacity, resourcefulness, and ruthless tactics. They carved out territories within the city, establishing themselves as a force to be reckoned with, challenging the oppressive rule of the wealthy elite.

The crew's activities ranged from illicit drug trade and smuggling to extortion and organized heists, targeting the symbols of opulence that taunted the impoverished masses. Yet, they weren't solely driven by criminal enterprises. Beneath the surface, the Cough City Crew harbored a desire to bring attention to the plight of the marginalized, to disrupt the status quo, and to dismantle the barriers that kept the lower classes oppressed.

Their actions garnered attention from both law enforcement and rival gangs, leading to fierce turf wars and intense power struggles. The Cough City Crew, however, proved to be a resilient force, adapting to ever-changing circumstances, and always finding new ways to defy their adversaries.

Within the gang's hierarchy, the Founding Four retained their status as the ultimate decision-makers, shaping the crew's strategies and objectives. Beneath them, a network of lieutenants and enforcers ensured the gang's operations ran smoothly, while foot soldiers proved their loyalty through acts of violence and unwavering allegiance.

Despite their reputation for criminal activities, the Cough City Crew held a certain twisted sense of honor within their ranks. They abided by an unwritten code, protecting their own and defending their territories with ferocity. They became a symbol of resistance for the disenfranchised, a beacon of hope for those who felt trapped in the merciless grip of inequality.

The story of the Cough City Crew continues to unfold, interwoven with the tumultuous history of Stickyickistan. As their influence waxes and wanes, their legacy endures—a testament to the indomitable spirit of those who rise up against the forces that seek to oppress them.
