This is a group of mostly street level thugs of [[Human]] origin, but they don't recruit members based on species or race. They live in a rough part of town known as [[Upper South Booftown]] or [[The Ashtray]]. They often clash with their native [[Halflings]] counterpart the [[Cough City Crew]]. They have some powerful high ranking members, but their main strength is in numbers. Their members are mostly recruited out of necessity.  In [[The Ashtray]] if you ain't in then you're out. Mostly young men, are recruited in to the gang as a way of making money for their families. They learn this from their fathers, uncles, and cousins a life of crime where you almost always end up dead or in shackles.
## A Vicious Cycle

You will notice that the descriptions of the [[Mandem on Booftown]], and [[Cough City Crew]] are very similar. This is part of an unfortunate reality for the two factions. They are both groups of poor disenfranchised people that are trying to make their way in the cut-throat capitalistic landscape of [[Stickyickistan]]. Because of these similarities they find themselves in the same lines of work, which breeds competition, which leads to resentment, then to contempt. When they go out on a hunt to the other side's hood, they pass up the woman carrying groceries, they pass up on the man wearing clothes from work. They go out looking for the guys that look like they do. And the cycle continues. An eye for an eye.
