This is the name of the noble house of the Northbourne family. House Northbourne is the third noble house that formed after [[Human Colonialism]]. They hold the least amount of power of any member in the [[Nevercough Tribunal]].
# Overview

Publicly, House Northbourne is the undisputed authority on animal breeding, training, and handling in [[Stickyickistan]]. They are the proud owners of [[The North Booftown Downs]], the city-state’s premier horse racing track, and the founders of the [[Handler’s Guild]], an elite organization specializing in the domestication and training of all manner of beasts, from prized racehorses to exotic war creatures. Their estate in [[North Booftown]], a grand plantation-style home surrounded by vast stables and pastures, serves as both their headquarters and a symbol of their power.

But behind this polished reputation, House Northbourne is far more than an animal-breeding dynasty. In criminal circles, they are whispered about as “[[The Norfies]]”, a name that strikes both fear and respect. Beneath their pristine façade, they control the largest illicit [[Alcohol]] distribution network in Stickyickistan, engage in high-stakes gambling and race-fixing, and operate secretive underground fighting rings.
#### **The Handler’s Guild & Magebred Supremacy**

While House Northbourne and the Handler’s Guild are officially separate entities, the Guild’s expertise is a direct product of Northbourne bloodlines. Certain members of the family are born with an innate magical talent for calming and controlling animals, allowing them to domesticate even the wildest and most dangerous creatures. This ability has made them the undisputed leaders in the [[Magebred Animals]] trade, and their livestock is sought after by nobles, warriors, and merchants alike.

But while the Handler’s Guild is respected, House Northbourne is feared. They apply the same ruthless efficiency to controlling their criminal empire as they do to breeding their prized stock.
#### **The Norfies’ Criminal Empire**

Despite their public standing, House Northbourne’s true wealth comes from the shadows. Their control of [[The North Booftown Downs]] allows them to fix races, manipulate odds, and control gambling syndicates, ensuring that every major bet benefits them in the end.

Beyond that, they are the largest illicit [[Alcohol]] distributors in Stickyickistan, running a sophisticated network of secret breweries and smuggling routes. Through layers of obfuscation, and plausible deniability, they employ brewers, alchemists, and mercenaries to produce and transport their contraband, ensuring that Stickyickistan’s thirst for forbidden spirits is always quenched—for a price.

When necessary, they hire outsiders for the dirty work, ensuring that if things go wrong, the blame falls on expendable hands, not Northbourne blood.
#### **The Estate & Their Unshakable Rule**

House Northbourne’s estate in North Booftown is more than just a breeding ground for elite animals—it is a fortified sanctuary, where business and family affairs intertwine. The plantation-style mansion, rolling pastures, and state-of-the-art stables create an air of refinement, but beneath this elegance lies an unshakable code:

> **The Family Comes First. Always.**

Outsiders may work for House Northbourne, but only those born or married into the bloodline are truly family. Even marriages are treated like carefully arranged breeding contracts, their genealogy scrutinized as much as their livestock before being approved by the Elders' Council. Few are ever truly accepted.
#### **The Monster Hunter’s Feast: A Luxurious Front for Blood sport**

Among their many ventures, House Northbourne owns a luxurious restaurant known as [[Belly of the Beast]] This high-end establishment is a shrine to Stickyickistan’s legendary monster & beast hunters, its walls lined with taxidermy of rare beasts, enchanted murals, and tapestries depicting grand hunts. Here, the city’s elite dine on exotic meats and rare delicacies, reveling in a world of luxury, status, and danger.

However, behind its refined atmosphere lies a far darker purpose. In the back of the restaurant, the grand dining hall can be transformed into an underground fighting pit, where monstrous creatures, captured warriors, and gladiators battle for the entertainment of the most exclusive guests, and sometimes money. These events are invitation-only, catering to the city’s wealthiest and most dangerous individuals.
