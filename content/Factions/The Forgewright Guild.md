#### **The Fabricators of Progress**

The Forgewright Guild is the pinnacle of [[Magitech]] craftsmanship in [[Stickyickistan]], responsible for engineering the constructs, arcane weaponry, and elemental machinery that fuel the city-state’s rapid advancement. Unlike the noble-founded guilds of old, the Forgewright Guild was the first major guild not formed by one of the [[Four Founding Houses]], making it a non-political entity—yet one that wields immense economic power.

Headquartered near the Industrial Zone, the guild’s massive foundries, forges, and arcane research labs churn out everything from fine-crafted mundane wares to revolutionary magitech innovations. Their cutting-edge research facilities in Mount Zooka’s Rim push the limits of construct design, Arcanite enhancement, and elemental engineering.
#### **Technological Wonders**

Among their greatest creations are:

- **The Warforged** – **Living constructs**, blending **machine and magic**, originally designed for combat but now finding roles throughout society.
- **Airships** – Elegant **floating vessels powered by bound elementals**, allowing **rapid travel and commerce** across Stickyickistan and beyond.
- **Lightning Rails & Elemental Vehicles** – High-speed **magitech transportation**, linking key areas of the city and revolutionizing travel and logistics.

Though the Forgewright Guild does not engage in **retail trade**, their items are **highly sought after**, bearing the **guild’s unmistakable sigil**, a mark of **quality, precision, and innovation**.

#### **The Power Behind the Forge**

The **Fabricator’s Guild** operates on a **production-first philosophy**, allowing merchants and distributors to handle sales while they **focus on innovation and crafting**. Despite their lack of direct retail operations, their **Magewrights and Tinkers Branch** dominate the **repair and maintenance industry**, ensuring that **all elemental and magitech machinery in Stickyickistan remains in Forgewright hands.**

Guild members are granted **exclusive magical benefits**, allowing them to **infuse items with arcane energy, repair damaged constructs, and outmatch competitors in craftsmanship**. Their **roaming tinkers and technicians** travel the city, providing **repair services and securing contracts**, further embedding the **Forgewright Guild’s presence in daily life.**

#### **The Future of Innovation**

With their unmatched **expertise in magitech fabrication**, the Forgewright Guild remains **at the forefront of Stickyickistan’s industrial and economic future**. Though **officially neutral**, they are deeply entangled in **power struggles with other organizations**, particularly the **Tribunal Highblade Coalition** (who view **Warforged soldiers as a threat**) and **The Seekers of the Vein**, who **supply them with raw Arcanite and metals** but often **push for greater influence over their operations**.

> **From airships to arcane weapons, constructs to commerce—if it shapes Stickyickistan’s future, the Forgewright Guild built it.**
