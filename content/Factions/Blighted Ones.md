A horde of rotting, deathless horrors, created by [[Valmorra the Hollowed]]'s [[Emerald Blight]], that roam the [[Ruins of Spliffholm]] in the [[Grim Forest]]. Despite their similarities in nature, the [[Ashenfey]] are not allies with the Blighted Ones because they only want death and decay, neglecting the balance that must be struck between death and growth. They generally don't stop them, but they don't help them either. Obviously the [[Verdanfey]] are a staunch enemy of the Blighted Ones, and often launch attacks into the [[Ruins of Spliffholm]] to cutdown the numbers of the blighted. Any native [[Halflings]] that follow any of [[The Three Sisters]] fight vehemently against the Blighted Ones unless they are [[Corrupted Acolytes of Shadash]] that have been corrupted by [[Lord Durakor]].
