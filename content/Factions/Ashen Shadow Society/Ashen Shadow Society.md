A replacement for [[The Legion of Steel]] from [[Dragonlance]].
# History

The Ashen Shadow Society is a bounty hunting guild in the realm of [[Stickyickistan]], headquartered in the bustling downtown district on [[Nevercough Island]]. The guild was born years ago in the shadowy underbelly of the city, starting as a loose network of ex-military operatives, hired swords, and wands for hire. From these humble beginnings, they quickly realized the immense profit to be made in the arcane chaos of Stickyickistan and its surroundings.

With the arrival of foreign settlers and merchants, Stickyickistan experienced unparalleled economic prosperity but also some of the most glaring economic inequalities in the multiverse. In the city’s early days, blue-collar crime ran rampant, and law enforcement struggled to keep up. The Ashen Shadow Society initially thrived by targeting those criminals that the authorities couldn’t catch, earning a reputation as effective enforcers of the law—for a price. Over time, however, their operations expanded significantly as the guild capitalized on the rapid development of Stickyickistanian magitechnology.

As magitechnology advanced, so too did organized crime. White-collar crime syndicates emerged, rivaling the traditional blue-collar offenses. This evolution created even more lucrative opportunities for the guild, enabling them to upgrade their facilities, weapons, and equipment. With these advancements, the Ashen Shadow Society began taking on increasingly high-profile and high-stakes contracts, eventually reaching the formidable level of influence they wield today.

Now, the Ashen Shadow Society operates as a powerful, semi-independent entity that often acts outside the bounds of the law. Though they once worked closely with law enforcement, they now follow their own rules, driven by profit above all else. Membership in the guild is highly exclusive, and only the most skilled and disciplined individuals are granted full status. Those who fail to meet their standards or fall out of favor are relegated to the “Support Squads”—a derisive term for teams assigned the most dangerous and thankless tasks, often serving as expendable assets for the higher-ranking members.

The guild’s primary goal has always been, and remains, the pursuit of wealth. "Money" to the Ashen Shadow Society isn’t just gold; it can also mean powerful magical items, influence, or eliminating obstacles to their profit margins. While they do not kill indiscriminately, they are mercenaries in the truest sense, willing to take any job—so long as the price is right. True to their chaotic neutral alignment, they are a dangerous and unpredictable force in Stickyickistan, a group guided by ambition and the allure of gold.
# Hierarchy

Within the clandestine world of the Ashen Shadow Society, a complex hierarchy governs the inner workings of the organization. Divided into squads and driven by internal competition, this system ensures power dynamics and control within the elite bounty hunter clan. Here is an overview of the hierarchy, where groups of four hold significant influence:
## The Council of Shadows:

At the pinnacle of power lies the Council of Shadows, composed of four highly influential figures within the Ashen Shadow Society. These individuals are the true leaders, pulling the strings from the shadows and determining the clan's overarching objectives. Their identities remain closely guarded secrets known by the Enigmatic Quartet, including [[Zara Blackthorn]]. The Council wields immense authority, making decisions that shape the destiny of the organization.
## The Enigmatic Quartet:

Directly beneath the Council of Shadows is the Enigmatic Quartet, a group of four renowned and enigmatic assassins who serve as the council's primary advisors. Each member possesses distinct skills and expertise, representing different facets of the clan's operations. The Enigmatic Quartet holds significant sway within the Ashen Shadow Society, their influence extending to strategic decision-making, resource allocation, and the execution of critical missions. They are known for their elusive nature, rarely seen in public and shrouded in mystery.
## The Squad Hierarchy:

Within the Ashen Shadow Society, squads of bounty hunters form the backbone of the organization. These squads consist of four highly skilled individuals who work together to complete missions and bring in lucrative bounties. Each squad operates with its own internal hierarchy, determined by the squad members themselves. The more money a squad brings in, the higher their status and privileges within the Ashen Shadow Society.
## Squad Ranks:

### a) Novices:

Novices are newly formed squads within the Ashen Shadow Society. They are comprised of bounty hunters who have recently joined forces and are still establishing their reputation. Novice squads are eager to prove themselves and climb the ranks of the organization. They undertake smaller missions and lower-paying bounties as they build their experience and teamwork.
### b) Bloodhounds:

Bloodhound squads have proven their mettle by successfully completing several mid-level missions and consistently bringing in substantial amounts of money. Their exceptional tracking skills and resourcefulness make them formidable adversaries. As Bloodhounds, these squads gain more recognition within the organization, earning access to higher-paying and more challenging contracts.
### c) Ravens:

Raven squads have established themselves as elite units within the Ashen Shadow Society. Their expertise, experience, and track record of high-value bounties set them apart from the rest. Ravens excel in both stealth and combat, making them versatile and highly sought after for specialized missions. Their accomplishments grant them respect and influence among their peers.
### d) Shadowsong:

Shadowsong squads are the pinnacle of success within the Ashen Shadow Society. They are legendary in their skill, notoriety, and the wealth they bring in. Shadowsong squads have mastered the art of bounty hunting, their prowess unmatched by any other unit. They operate with precision, efficiency, and lethal effectiveness. Shadowsong squads are entrusted with the most dangerous and lucrative missions, and their successes are celebrated throughout the organization.
## Squad Competition and Rewards:

Squads within the Ashen Shadow Society compete fiercely to bring in the largest sums of money. The more successful a squad is in completing high-value contracts, the more missions they are entrusted with, leading to greater opportunities for wealth and advancement. A squad's rank determines their cut of the earnings, allowing higher-ranked squads to enjoy a larger share of the bounty.
  
As squads rise through the ranks, they gain access to better resources, equipment, and support from the organization. They also gain recognition and influence among their peers, solidifying their position within the Ashen Shadow Society.

It is through this dynamic hierarchy that squads of bounty hunters strive to ascend and establish their reputation, ultimately aiming to catch the attention of The Enigmatic Quartet and the Council of Shadows, the ultimate arbiters of power within the organization.
# Support Squad:

The support characters are recruits that have shown they don’t have what it takes to be on an actual ASS bounty hunting squad, but they can still be useful. Since they are recruits, they have seen the inside of the citadel, therefore if they don’t survive they can’t tell any tales.
