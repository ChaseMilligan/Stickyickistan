Velindra Ashveil wasn’t born into the sky, but she was always meant to rule it.

Raised in the smog-choked streets of [[The Ashtray]], Velindra grew up among criminals, smugglers, and airship pirates. Her infernal lineage marked her as an outsider, but it was her sharp wit and quicker hands that kept her alive. By the time she was sixteen, she had already hijacked her first skiff and outmaneuvered the city watch in a daring escape—earning herself both a bounty and a reputation.

She should have been just another ghost lost to the winds of the black-market trade routes, but fate had other plans.

One fateful night, during a storm over the [[Ocean]], Velindra found herself aboard a damaged smuggler vessel, desperately trying to keep it afloat as a bounty hunter airship closed in. The hunters? A seasoned squad of the [[Ashen Shadow Society]], there to bring in her crew. But instead of capturing her, they recognized her talent—how she navigated the ship through razor-sharp winds and erratic lightning, her hands moving like they were guided by unseen forces.

“_You don’t belong with these gutter rats, girl._” The captain told her, watching as static energy flickered along her fingers. “_Come with me, and I’ll show you what you’re really worth._”

She took the deal.
