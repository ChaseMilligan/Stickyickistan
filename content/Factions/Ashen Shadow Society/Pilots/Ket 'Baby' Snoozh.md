Ket "Baby" Snoozh grew up in the lower wards of [[Stickyickistan]], where the sky was something you could see only if you climbed high enough—or stole a ride. He never knew his parents, just that they were long gone, leaving him to scrape by in the back alleys of the city. From an early age, he had two things going for him: a silver tongue and hands faster than most eyes could follow.

He started as a pickpocket, lifting coins from distracted airship dock workers, then graduated to running errands for sky smugglers, slipping contraband past the watchful gaze of [[House Varkos]]' airport guards. By twelve, he had already stowed away on his first airship, and by fifteen, he had tricked a washed-up pilot into giving him lessons in exchange for a fake map to a "lost treasure vault." The map was worthless, but the skills he learned stuck.

Now, at seventeen, Ket has joined the [[Ashen Shadow Society]], and earned a reputation as one of the best up and coming pilots-for-hire in the guild. He doesn’t fly for noble causes or high ideals—just cold hard cash and the thrill of the wind in his face. He’s got no house, no lineage, and no fucks to give, but he doesn’t need them. His wits and instincts keep him soaring through the sky.

Why do they call him “Baby?” Some say it’s because he always plays the innocent act before pulling the rug out from under you. Others claim it’s because he was raised in the streets, barely more than a child when he started running with criminals. Ket just smirks when people ask.

One thing’s for sure—if you need a ship flown fast, Ket "Baby" Snoozh is your guy… as long as you can pay.
