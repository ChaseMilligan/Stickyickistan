House Stonemug is the youngest of [[Stickyickistan]]’s noble houses, yet one of its most resilient and ambitious. Unlike the [[Human]]-led noble houses that emerged after [[Human Colonialism]], the Stonemugs were determined to carve out their own [[Dwarf]] kingdom in [[Bongstad]]—a vision that set them at odds with the ruling elite of [[Nevercough Island]].

For decades, House Stonemug resisted integration, seeking to establish Bongstad as an independent dwarven stronghold, free from [[Nevercough Tribunal]]'s control. However, their dream ended with the fall of [[Spliffholm]] and the outbreak of the [[Emerald Blight]]. Faced with the threat of civil war among the dwarven houses, the Stonemugs reluctantly abandoned their claim to kingship, instead solidifying their power through wealth, industry, and enterprise.

Today, House Stonemug rules not as monarchs, but as masters of trade and industry, controlling a Mining & Jeweller's guild named [[The Seekers of the Vein]] who own the richest mines in Bongstad and dominating the precious metal and gemstone trade. Their influence extends far beyond Stickyickistan, as their immense wealth and resources have allowed them to establish ties with foreign powers throughout the multiverse.

Despite their economic dominance, House Stonemug still maintains a militaristic edge. Their house-trained mercenaries serve as elite guards for their mining operations, jewelry trade, and business partners. They also hire out squads to organizations such as [[The Forgewright Guild]], ensuring their deep connection to [[Magitech]] innovation remains profitable.
