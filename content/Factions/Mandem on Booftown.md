# Backstory
  
In the neighboring district of Booftown, a rival gang to the Cough City Crew emerged, known as Mandem on Booftown, or MOB for short. Booftown, predominantly populated by the native halflings who had long suffered under the influence of the human settlers, became the breeding ground for this fierce and brutal gang.

MOB's origins can be traced back to a time of deep resentment and seething anger within Booftown. The halfling population had endured years of oppression, their rights trampled upon by the dominating human settlers who controlled the city. As the divide between the haves and the have-nots grew wider, a group of halfling individuals decided it was time to take matters into their own hands.

Led by four charismatic and ruthless figures, MOB rose to prominence as the voice of the marginalized halfling community. The leaders, known by their street names, were Jinx "Razorblade" Willowbark, Felix "Brawler" Thornfoot, Lexi "Scarlet" Bramblethorn, and Remy "Torchlight" Goldleaf. Each of them brought their unique skills and ferocity to the forefront, earning their positions as the key figures within the gang.

Unlike their rival, the Cough City Crew, MOB emphasized brutality and intimidation over finesse and strategy. They earned a reputation for their ruthless tactics, leaving a trail of violence and chaos in their wake. Their methods were often crude, employing fear and sheer force to establish dominance within their territories.

The name "Mandem on Booftown" reflected their close-knit unity and loyalty to their native district. "Mandem" was a term used by halflings to refer to a tight-knit group of friends or associates, emphasizing the bond that united the gang members. Booftown, despite its oppressive conditions, was their home, and MOB was determined to make their mark within it.

MOB's activities included extortion, racketeering, and brutal acts of violence against rival gangs and those who opposed their rule. They targeted the symbols of human affluence and authority, seeking to dismantle the structures that had oppressed their community for far too long. They operated with a blatant disregard for the law, viewing themselves as the enforcers of their own brand of justice.

Within the gang's hierarchy, the four leaders remained at the top, overseeing the gang's operations and ensuring their message of rebellion reverberated throughout Booftown. Beneath them, lieutenants and enforcers enforced MOB's rule with an iron fist, instilling fear in the hearts of those who dared to challenge their authority.

While MOB may have lacked the finesse and strategic acumen of their rivals, the Cough City Crew, they made up for it with their sheer brutality and unwavering determination. They were a force to be reckoned with, unleashing their fury upon any who dared to cross their path.

As the rivalry between MOB and the Cough City Crew intensified, the streets of Stickyickistan became a battleground for power and control. The clashes between the two gangs were marked by bloodshed and devastation, leaving a lasting impact on the city and its inhabitants.

MOB's legacy would forever be intertwined with the struggle for justice and liberation within Booftown. While their methods may have been harsh and their actions ruthless, they served as a symbol of defiance for the marginalized halfling communityâ€”a stark reminder that sometimes, strength and brutality were the only means of survival against overwhelming odds.
