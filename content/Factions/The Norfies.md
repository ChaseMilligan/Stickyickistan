# House Northbourne Overview

Publicly, [[House Northbourne]] is the undisputed authority on animal breeding, training, and handling in [[Stickyickistan]]. Certain members of the family are born with an innate magical talent for calming and controlling animals, allowing them to domesticate even the wildest and most dangerous creatures. This ability has made them the undisputed leaders in the [[Magebred Animals]] trade, and their livestock is sought after by nobles, warriors, and merchants alike.

They are the proud owners of [[The North Booftown Downs]], the city-state’s premier horse racing track, and the founders of the [[Handler’s Guild]], an elite organization specializing in the domestication and training of all manner of beasts, from prized racehorses to exotic war creatures. Their estate in [[North Booftown]], a grand plantation-style home surrounded by vast stables and pastures, serves as both their headquarters and a symbol of their power.

But behind this polished reputation, House Northbourne is far more than an animal-breeding dynasty. In criminal circles, they are whispered about as “The Norfies”, a name that strikes both fear and respect. Beneath their pristine façade, they control the largest illicit [[Alcohol]] distribution network in Stickyickistan, engage in high-stakes gambling and race-fixing, and operate secretive underground fighting rings.
