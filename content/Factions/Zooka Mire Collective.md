A small breakaway sect of the [[Golgari Swarm]] that has found their way to Stickyickistan, and inhabit a swampy region of [[The Outback]] just outside city limits known as [[Zooka Mire]].

- The Zooka Mire Collective is the guild that fuses the opposite values of life and death, fostering growth in [[Stickyickistan]]'s decaying communities but also fostering decay in places of growth.
- The [[Halflings]], zombies, insects, and undead-plant hybrids of [[Zooka Mire]] are like one massive, growing, feeding organism, collectively spreading across the land wherever it can fit. 
- The Zooka Mire Collective provide a necessary service in [[Stickyickistan]], in that they dispose of the carcasses, and magitech waste that civilization leaves behind, and mysteriously they also provide sustenance for the forgotten and the downtrodden. 
- They are the scavengers and decomposers at the fringes of the food chain, but yearn to be the predator at the top.
- The collective is organized more like a single organism than a typical guild: it has a nucleus or nerve center that drives the direction and growth of the collective; elements that collect nutrients and convert them into usable resources; defenses that resist and fight off foreign bodies; and an instinctual drive to survive, reproduce, and overcome. 
- The Zooka Mire Guild Master is currently [[Fester Von Zaaza]] an undead necromancer who managed to revive himself after death. 
- Fester maintains a council of shamans, arcanists, and rogues called [[The Rotwake]]. The Rotwake act as a combination of advisory parliament and spy agency and rarely all convene publicly or together at once. 
- In combination with Fester's insect minions, they act as his sensory apparatus to know what the outer reaches of the collective are doing and as a messenger service to deliver instructions.
- It might be that an individual of The Rotwake might be considered of higher rank than another by Fester, but none know those rankings beyond the guild master. 
- The Zooka Mire Collective might have more changes in leadership than other guilds. The guild believes in the importance of continuous cycles, understands that assassination is a valid means of political conquest, and knows that being alive is not a prerequisite to rule.
