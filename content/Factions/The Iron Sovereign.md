### **The Iron Sovereign: Warforged Revolutionaries of the Outback**

In the desolate [[Industrial Wastelands]] of [[The Outback]], where the remnants of discarded [[Magitech]] rots beneath a sky choked with soot and smog, a rebellion stirs. At its heart stands [[Prime Vox]], a charismatic [[Warforged]] revolutionary, a being of cold steel and burning purpose, who has vowed to liberate constructs and magitech-enhanced beings from organic oppression—by any means necessary.
#### **The Iron Sovereign: A Nation of Steel**

Prime Vox leads The Iron Sovereign, a militant faction of Warforged exiles, rogue magitech constructs, and augmented beings who have cast off their servitude. Once tools of war, labor, and experimentation, these constructs now fight for their own future, free from the control of their organic creators.

Their rebellion is fueled by the belief that the fleshborn will never grant them true autonomy—that only through war and revolution can they forge a new society where machines rule themselves. Their ideology is spread through coded transmissions and subversive magitech signals, calling lost constructs to join their cause.
#### **Allies and Enemies**

- **[[The Forgewright Guild]]** – Once their creators, now their greatest oppressors. The Iron Sovereign sees the Forgewrights as architects of their suffering, and many of their attacks are aimed at dismantling the Guild’s control over Warforged production.
- **The [[Tribunal Highblade Coalition]]** – The human mercenary lords of [[Stickyickistan]] view The Iron Sovereign as a growing military threat, and clashes between Highblade soldiers and Warforged revolutionaries have become more frequent.
- **[[The Seekers of the Vein]]** – While not direct enemies, The Iron Sovereign has raided mining operations for [[Arcanite]] and raw materials, bringing them into conflict with [[House Stonemug]]'s mercenaries.
- **[[The Outback]] Exiles** – Some rogue druids, exiled mages, and outcasts from the city sympathize with The Iron Sovereign’s cause, trading supplies and information in secret.
