# **Origins & The Highblade Conquests**

Before they became the premier mercenary house of [[Stickyickistan]], the Tribunal Highblade Coalition (THC) was known as [[House Highblade]], a powerful militant noble family that rose to prominence during the early days of [[Human Colonialism]]. Backed by the [[Nevercough Tribunal]], the Highblades led a brutal campaign of conquest across what is now [[Upper South Booftown]] and [[Lower South Booftown]], bringing the region under the Tribunal’s control.

At the time, these lands were sparsely populated but fiercely defended by numerous native [[Halflings]] factions. Despite their resilience, most of these groups were crushed, displaced, or driven into [[The Outback]], where their remnants survive to this day. Through this conquest, House Highblade secured a reputation as an unyielding military force, loyal to the Tribunal and instrumental in shaping the human-dominated colonial order.
# **House Highblade & The Formation of the Tribunal Highblade Coalition**

Over time, warfare became a business, and House Highblade adapted. While the noble house maintained its ancestral status and holdings, its military forces evolved into the Tribunal Highblade Coalition—an elite mercenary house for hire that serves as a semi-independent military arm of the Nevercough Tribunal.

Now headquartered in the imposing [[Highblade Tower]] on Nevercough Island, the Tribunal Highblade Coalition operates as a neutral yet formidable force, selling its soldiers and war tacticians to the highest bidder while maintaining strong ties to Nevercough’s elite power structure. Most of its commanders and officers hail from House Highblade’s bloodline, ensuring that the noble family still holds deep influence over the Coalition’s leadership. However, while House Highblade remains a noble dynasty, the Coalition is a military enterprise—loyalty is earned through skill, experience, and discipline rather than blood alone.
# **Enemies in Business**

Since the decline of Human Colonialism, the Tribunal Highblade Coalition has clashed with rival organizations, not over ideology, but over business. In the world of private security, bounty hunting, and mercenary work, competition is fierce, and THC will not tolerate threats to its dominance.

- [[The Forgewright Guild]]’s [[Warforged]] Mercenaries – The rise of Warforged soldiers as independent combatants threatens THC’s supremacy. A tireless, obedient soldier-for-hire is bad for business, and the Coalition does everything in its power to undermine, discredit, or eliminate Warforged mercenary operations.
- [[The Seekers of the Vein]] – Prospecting mercenaries hired by the Seekers to guard expeditions and mining sites pose an issue for THC, who once dominated the security contracts for such endeavors. Where once Highblades patrolled the veins of [[Arcanite]], now Seekers’ men have begun carving out their own power, and the Coalition sees them as an insulting upstart force.
- The [[Ashen Shadow Society]] – THC prides itself on discipline, organization, and professionalism. The Ashen Shadow Society, on the other hand, is a guild of lawless bounty hunters and assassins, operating without honor, codes, or restrictions. The two groups have competed over high-profile contracts, and the Highblades view the Ashen Shadow Society as dishonorable killers who make a mockery of their trade. The rivalry has led to violent clashes between the two factions, though neither dares go to open war—yet.
# **The Highblade Name & The Future of the Coalition**

While House Highblade still exists, it is a noble institution first and foremost, overseeing the family’s estates, political alliances, and aristocratic affairs. It is still influential within the Nevercough Tribunal, but its military power now rests in the hands of the Tribunal Highblade Coalition, which acts as a separate yet closely aligned organization.

In Stickyickistan, war is a business, and THC ensures that no one profits from war quite like they do. Whether guarding high-ranking officials, crushing uprisings, or launching preemptive strikes against rivals, the Coalition sells its steel to those who can afford it—all while House Highblade watches from the heights of its ancestral throne, ensuring their bloodline remains at the center of power.
