# The Case: A Debt Ignited

The murder involves [[Tomiir Greatfall]], a down-on-his-luck dwarven gambler who owes money to members of a powerful bounty hunting guild, The [[Ashen Shadow Society]]. Tomiir recently came into a streak of extraordinary gambling luck after discovering an ancient [[Arcanite]] flask in some ruins in [[The Outback]]. The flask held a bound Efreeti, [[Casha Sang]], who promised him power in exchange for freedom. Desperate, Tomiir made a wish to become an unbeatable gambler.
## Key Characters

#### [[Tomiir Greatfall]]
A stocky, nervous dwarf with braided black hair. Once a proud soldier, his life fell apart after a losing streak in the city’s back-alley gambling dens.
#### [[Casha Sang]]
An Efreeti trapped in a magical flask. She is charming, manipulative, and vengeful, with a fiery temper. In her weakened state, she takes on the appearance of a beautiful woman in a flowing red dress.
#### [[Bralma Firehand]]
The brutal dwarven leader of Unit BH-IgnisΩ5. She planned to make an example of Tomiir but instead became the victim of Casha’s fiery wrath.
#### [[Drudak Emberbrew]]
An orc bartender and owner of [[The Molten Note]], a smoky tavern where Tomiir frequently gambles and Casha sings.
#### [[Thynar Moltensteel]]
A corrupt guard on Bralma's payroll, stationed near the scene of the crime.
## The Murder

The players are hired to investigate the gruesome deaths of Bralma Firehand and her squad in an alley behind [[The Ashen Leaf]], an old boarded up, and foreclosed tobacco shop. Witnesses report hearing screams and seeing a figure flee, while others speak of strange magical flames lingering in the air.
## The Flask and the Temple

The mysterious magical flask leads to an ancient extraplanar temple created by Casha Sang after she altered the flask’s magic. Here, Casha Sang’s power resides in an altar to herself. 

The flask’s original wondrous nature was a magical [[Alcohol]] brewery, and cellar called [[The Brew Master's Flask]]. This flask was buried deep beneath [[Mount Zooka]] long ago by the [[Nevercough Tribunal]] since its alcoholic nature was strictly against their agenda of an [[Arcannabis]] based economy. It was eventually discovered by Casha Sang, and altered to fit her needs as a fire elemental.

The players must discover the connection between Tomiir, the murders, and the flask while navigating the dangers of both the urban underworld and the temple’s fiery traps. Th flask returns to its original nature when Casha Sang is defeated.
# 1. The Crime Scene

*A guard of the Nevercough Tribunal that was stationed nearby was the first on the scene. Luckily this was a specific guard who has close ties to this case. This guard’s name is Thynar Moltensteel. He was apparently getting paid off by the deceased to look the other way when she went about her business of loan sharking in the area.* 

*Thynar contacted us before he contacted his superiors, so we could send some info techs to quickly scan the crime scene with (REDACTED) before his colleagues arrived. Our info techs weren’t able to investigate the scene, but Thynar gave us his testimony of what he saw, and heard. He heard screaming and a brief, but intense struggle. As he hoofed it towards the commotion, he saw a hooded dwarf with a braided beard running away from the bodies, and duck into a side street.*

*Thynar chased after the figure, but was unable to catch another glimpse. Our scan of the scene allows us to recreate it in the [[Combat Training Facility]]. I will warn you as well that Thynar, and our info techs were attacked by the deceased after they reportedly “reanimated in flames”. You guys will be sent into the simulation, and investigate the scene for any clues on the bodies.* 

*We are assuming the bodies will reanimate in the simulation as well, so do your investigations quickly, and maybe you can get out of the simulation before they presumably attack. Like right now. This is absolutely unacceptable. Whoever, or whatever did this must be identified and slain immediately as far as I am concerned. Vengeance is top priority for the guild. We will be paying you for the service. Show them who they are messing with.*

In the simulator they are sent to the scene of the crime. A soot-stained alley in [[Upper South Booftown]]. Burned bodies lie among melted cobblestones, while Everbright lanterns flicker in the thick ash-filled air. Clues include singed weapons (no DC), gold coins (DC 8), and a matchbook from [[The Molten Note]] tavern (DC 13). If the gold coins are found, an additional DC 10 investigation reveals that one of the coins is actually a gambling chip from The Molten Note. If the party prioritizes haste, and doesn’t fail two or more rolls, do not attack with the [[Flaming Zombies]]. Attack them for failed rolls and lollygagging.
# 2. [[The Molten Note]]

A bustling, dimly lit gambling den and music hall. Players can question patrons, gamble with Tomiir’s friend [[Erin Shortaxe]], or watch Casha Sang perform. The atmosphere is a mix of smoke, neon glows, and the clinking of enchanted dice.
### Drudak (The Barkeep)

The orc behind the bar is Drudak. He is happy to talk to them and tell them what he knows as long as they are paying for drinks. He can tell them:

- A patron fitting the description given by the witness frequents the tavern, a man named Tomiir Greatfall
- Tomiir is a heavy drinker and gambler. He doesn’t work so he spends most of his time either at home or here in The Molten Note
- Tomiir is bad at gambling, despite his obsession with it. His luck seems to have turned recently, however
- Tomiir is a veteran of the [[Nevercough Tribunal]] military but doesn't like to talk about it. Drudak reckons his deployment is why Tomiir is so partial to drinking and gambling. He respects that Tomiir, represented [[Stickyickistan]] is battle abroad, so he has never had the heart to ban him
- Tomiir is good friends with Erin Shortaxe, another frequent patron of the bar (Points her out at a dice table)
- Tomiir isn’t very social and doesn’t speak with many others when not at the table. However Drudak has seen him pestering Casha Sang, the new singer, here after her show a couple of times
- Tomiir lives deep in [[Lower South Booftown]] at 112 Bakers Close. He once had to take Tomiir home after he’d gotten particularly zooked at the bar
### Erin Shortaxe

Erin will ask the party to play a game with her if they want to talk. She will be hesitant to say anything too spicy inside the tavern. Erin has 200gp for gambling at the table. Erin can tell the players everything that Drudak can in addition to the following:

- Tomiir has been uncharacteristically lucky at the gambling tables lately. He’s even been banned from a few gambling halls because they think he’s cheating
- Tomiir is clearly infatuated with Casha Sang, the new singer here in The Molten Note. He insists on speaking with her after every show
- (Secret) She knows Tomiir is deep in debt to Bralma Firehand and that she and her squad were coming around asking about him, clearly intending to collect. However she is reluctant to give away this information and requires a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince her to talk
- (Secret) She’s worried that Tomiir has done something stupid. They were talking about Tomiir’s debt problems a couple of weeks ago when Erin joked that he could raid some ruins in the Outback for relics to sell. Since then Tomiir has been acting strangely but is dismissive when asked about it. She’s also reluctant to admit her involvement here in case she’s somehow implicated. A DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check is required to convince her to talk about this
### Gambling

They will play a dice version of Texas hold ‘em poker called [[Fist]]. A big and small blind will be identified by using d20 rolls. Highest in roll is small blind, and the next highest is big blind. Blind price won’t scale throughout for simplicity sake. Minimum buy in is 50gp, maximum is 500gp. SB pays 1gp, and BB pays 2gp to start the pot, then everyone rolls 2d6 to themselves (and GM). Based on these rolls the players can take the normal poker actions of call, raise, fold. After all pre-flop actions are taken the house dealer rolls the 3d6 flop, and the game progresses as a normal poker game would with players connecting a 5d6 “hand” with their 2d6 and the board. Hands are as follows from highest to lowest:

- Five-of-a-kind
- Four-of-a-kind
- Full House
- Straight
- Three-of-a-kind
- Two-pair
- Pair
# 3. Tomiir’s Shack

You emerge back onto the narrow streets and head back into Booftown. As you travel the buildings around you grow smaller, more cramped and more derelict. The stone buildings give way to simpler cookie cutter trailer-like homes, some falling to disrepair. Eventually you reach Bakers Close, a large collection of small, rickety buildings, clearly no more than a room or two each. It doesn’t take long to find number 112, a small building, little more than a hut, with no windows.

The door to Tomiir’s House is locked, requiring a DC 12 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check to open, though it is also quite flimsy and can be broken open with a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.

When the players enter: You enter into a small abode consisting of a single room and you are immediately hit with the smell of stale sweat, and sulfur. The room is simple with no decoration and few furnishings. On one side there is a small wooden bed, beside which is a bedside cabinet. On the other side of the room is a chest of drawers next to a full-size vanity dresser with a free-standing mirror in a dark wooden frame, ornately carved with depictions of flames.

Inside the cabinet is a half-empty bottle of moonshine and a journal. The final entries in the journal read:

- Two weeks ago: Firehand is pissed. If I don’t get her money soon I’m done for. Erin says there are treasures deep in the ground under the city. Maybe I’ll find something?
    
- One week ago: Meeting Casha is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I don't understand what she did but gambling is so easy now. I’ll have the money back in no time.
    
- Yesterday: Got the cash. Going to meet Firehand tomorrow.

The chest of drawers mostly contain old clothes, however one contains a pair of [Winged Boots](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4804-winged-boots) and a [Potion of Healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/8960641-potion-of-healing) that Casha gifted Tomiir. Tomiir wasn’t particularly interested in either.

On top of the drawers there is a very old looking normal sized flask. If inspected, the party will immediately notice that a runic script has been carved into the flask ad-hoc clearly exposing shiny metal beneath the weathered exterior of the flask. Also engraved on the bottom in common in text that looks just as weathered as the rest of the flask is a riddle.

*“Fill me up and let me flow to the floor*

*From above thy head to thy toe opens a door”*

The key to opening the doorway into the flask is to use the bottle of whiskey found in the bedside table. When poured from above the head of the holder, the alcohol flowing from the flask forms a gateway into the flask’s inside. Any alcohol will work. The flask then floats in mid air with the gate open. Since the flask is currently being used by Casha Sang as her elemental temple of fire power, the runic inscription will glow orange when the gate is opening and the edges of the gate catch on fire. Casha has compromised the security of the flask with her magical alteration of the artifact. Her tampering made it so the gate can be opened by someone who is not attuned to the item, and multiple creatures can cross the threshold to the inside of the flask Players entering the flaming gateway must succeed a DC 12 DEX saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage. Casha, however, is the only one who can close the gate.

If they take too long to solve the puzzle: The door abruptly opens and you see a woman standing in the doorway. She wears an elegant ruby-red evening dress, has fiery red hair which curls down her back, and smokes through a cigarette holder. You recognize her as the singer from The Molten Note. She exhales smoke and asks: “I suppose you are trying to find Tomiir?”

Casha Sang enters the room and deflects any questions they throw her way. She knows Tomiir is in her temple and wishes to protect him. Knowing that the players will ultimately figure out how to work the flask, she is merely trying to stall them so she can get there first. If they attack her, she immediately reduces to ashes which open the flask gate, and then she will fly towards the gate and into it. 

If they do not attack her, then: She approaches the flask and grabs the bottle of whiskey as if to prepare a drink, fills the flask, holds it above her head, and begins pouring it out onto the floor. The whiskey falls to the floor, but as it reaches the floor you see it start to flow back up to the flask, making an oval shaped ring of whiskey in the air. The runic inscription on the flask glows orange and the whiskey ring catches fire, revealing another room through the whiskey ring and the strong scent of sulfur. She turns towards you and smiles, then clicks her fingers. Immediately you are blinded by a flash of light, and as your vision returns the room around you has changed dramatically. The door, flask and other items in the room are gone. As is the floor. Instead you each stand upon a tiny platform above a 50 foot drop into lava. You can hear the sizzle and feel the intense heat coming from below. The walls of the room are severely scorched.

The changes to the room are an illusion created by the spell Major Image. If the players test the illusion in any way, they will find the floor is still there, as are the other contents of the room. Once they have confirmed it is an illusion, it fades. The entrance through the gate remains open.

# 4. The Temple of Ash and Flame

Upon entering Casha’s shrine, they step onto a platform that appears to be above a 50 ft. drop straight into lava below. They can feel the heat and hear the sizzle of the molten lava below them, and the room smells very strongly of sulfur. The changes to the room are an illusion created by the spell [Major Image](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619025-major-image). If the players test the illusion in any way, they will find the floor is still there, as are the other contents of the room. Once they have confirmed it is an illusion, it fades. The entrance through the gate remains open. 

Stepping through the gate you find yourself in a small, dark chamber with mosaic tiled walls and a cracked marble floor. The mosaic tiles depict strange angular patterns in black against a white background, though some tiles have come loose. A staircase leads downwards towards a door made of dark marble. The strong scent of sulfur hangs in the air.

If the players listen at the door, a DC 10 Wisdom (perception) check is required to hear the faint sound of sobbing from the other side. 

When they open the door: You open the door into a large chamber. As before the walls are mosaiced with most displaying similar black angular patterns on a white background. The far wall however has a colorful depiction of a woman silhouetted in flames as a forest burns around her. In the center of the room is an altar, atop which is a stone carving of a woman. Resting on the altar is an unstoppered ceramic flask. Two alcoves on each of the side walls contain lit braziers which illuminate the room. Kneeling with his back to the altar and facing the doorway is an unusually tall dwarf with long black hair pulled into three large braids and a short beard split into two small braids.

The kneeling dwarf is Tomiir Greatfall, who hid here in a panic after the murder.

If the players solved the mirror puzzle before Casha arrived then Tomiir is alone. When he sees the players: He looks up trembling. “Please, it’s not what it seems. It wasn’t me. It was... her. I thought she was going to help me, but instead she ruined everything. And she’s coming for me, I know she’s coming!” 

If the players ask him what happened he’ll do his best to explain, but he’s flustered and is struggling to make himself understood. He starts to tell them:

- He was in trouble and needed money fast
- Desperate, he went looking for treasure in the Outback
- He found a flask, and this place, and he released “her”

Before he can explain more than this, Casha Sang enters: You see fear cross the dwarfs eyes as he looks past you. You turn and see a woman coming down the stairs. She wears an elegant, ruby-red evening dress, has fiery red hair which curls down her back and smokes through a cigarette holder. You recognise her as the singer from The Grooved Axe. She slowly exhales smoke and says “Now Tomiir, I hope you aren’t speaking ill of me, are you?”

If the players failed to solve the mirror puzzle before Casha arrived then she is already here. When they first enter: He looks up, trembling. “Please, it’s not what it seems. It wasn’t me. It was... her.” The woman in red emerges from behind the altar and walks towards him. “Quiet now, you know it was for your protection.” Regardless of whether the players solved the mirror puzzle, Casha will humor them and answer a few questions. She can reveal:

- That she has helped Tomiir and in exchange he has been helping her. They need each other
- That fool Firehand wanted more than just repayment for Tomiir’s debt, she also wanted to take one of his fingers. Casha couldn’t allow her to harm Tomiir 

After a short time: The woman begins to look impatient. “I think this is enough conversation. You all now know too much... regretfully, I must now deal with you”. She waves a hand and in an instant she burns away to ash, ash that floats through the air towards Tomiir. He panics, scuttling away from it but with a scream is consumed by it and erupts into flames. The ash recedes and you see Tomiir, now burned to a skeleton, stand up. He holds his skeletal hands out in front of him and each erupts into flames. The remainder of the woman's ash forms into a ghostly visage of her face, her hair flowing above like flames. She floats in the air behind “Tomiir”.

Casha has taken control of Tomiir, turning him into a [[Flamelock]] (with mage armor). She has also exerted herself as far as she is capable so she can utilize a small portion of the power she used to wield, in the form of a [[Face of Flames]]. Both of them attack the players. During the fight if Casha is reduced to 0 HP she disintegrates once again to ash which flies into the altar. On her next turn the ash pours from the lamp and her face of flames form is recreated with half health. If the altar is destroyed while she is inside it, or she is reduced to 0 HP after the altar has been destroyed then she dies permanently. The altar has an AC of 10 and 8 HP. Once she is defeated all creatures are forced out of the flask as it returns to its original wondrous state as [[The Brew Master's Flask]]. It will be on the ground beneath where it was floating while the gate was open. The sigils that were carved into the front face are now gone. If the gate is opened it now leads to the magical [[Alcohol]] cellar.

 If during the fight Tomiir is reduced to 15 HP or below, he will fight against Casha’s control and gasp “The altar! It must be destroyed...” before once again losing himself to her. If Tomiir still lives when Casha is permanently killed he will revert back to his original form, alive. With his binding to Casha severed, he can now tell them everything that happened.
