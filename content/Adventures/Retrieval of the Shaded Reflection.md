- **Location**: [[Bongstad]]
- **Brief**: During excavation for a new residential development in Bongstad, the crew broke into a cave. The company sent some workers down to inspect what they had uncovered, but only one returned. What he described was pretty harrowing. His testimony was spread around, and caught the attention of Lady Mizzera Ambruson from the Nevercough Museum. She believes what he described could lead to the discovery of a fabled magical artifact that she would pay a grandiose amount of money for.

# Adventure

## 1. Descending Down

The party begins their descent into a deep cave with enough room to enter in a comfortable single file. With their marching order decided and lighting situation covered, read the following out loud: 

*Your light glints of the dry, jagged cave walls. The air grows colder and each step echoes through the silence. Your shadows dance across the stone as the floor slopes further and deeper still. A quiet fifteen minutes pass until you arrive in a large cavern with tall stalagmites rising to the ceiling shrouded in darkness. Your light flickers as a shadow darts by, but it is not one of yours.*

This is the start of the first monster fight. If the players succeed on a DC 15 Perception check, they spot the first monster before it can attack them, otherwise they will be surprised and the Dark Devourer will attack the player furthest away from a light source.
## 2. Fight - The Dark Devourer 

[[The Dark Devourer]] has spawned from the influence of the mirror and is simply a shadow of the original monster. It appears as a moving shadow with glowing red eyes. Outside of the first attack, it will try to attack the player closest to any light source in attempts to snuff out the light. The Dark Devourer will use Shadow Attack at the start of its turn every round. This is a mandatory ability for it. The players should understand from this encounter that fighting in darkness is fatally dangerous.
## 3. Defeated Dark Devourer 

When the players defeat the Dark Devourer, read the following out loud: 

*The body of the shadowy figure collapses onto the ground as the red in its eyes dissipates. A clattering sound can be heard as a black hand mirror falls out from its torso area. Nearly as soon as the mirror hits the ground, the stone ruptures beneath the corpse, and the body and mirror fall into the fresh gaping hole leading deeper below.* 

The hole is a 5ft square and drops down 30ft before it enters into a small cave. At the bottom of the cave, the body and mirror are nowhere to be seen and there is a narrow passage that leads even deeper. The mirror itself does not reflect anything and is simply a dark void. It is a mirror image of the hand mirror itself and will phase through objects, creatures, and terrain if held too long. Read the following out loud as the party members make their way through the narrow passageway: 

*The air grows colder as you all descend foot by foot, deep into the earth. The rock becomes smoother and the passage begins to open up slightly, enough to stand comfortably, then wider, enough to fight comfortably. And wider still, just enough to fight side by side. And then, an acrid smell hits your noses. The smell of chemicals and rotting flesh.*  

If the party succeeds on a DC 10 Perception check, they will notice that there seems to be small claw marks along the walls and the floor. If the party succeeds on a DC 15 Investigation check, they will notice that in some parts of walls of the cave, it seems like the stone has been melted away by some sort of corrosive substance. If the party succeeds on a DC 15 Nature check, they will notice that the floor of the cave seems to be made of a different type of rock.
## 4. The Silent Spawner and Sick Spawn

In the claustrophobic corridor, the party is rushed by a swarm of five [[Sick Spawn]]. The Sick Spawn are small ladybug-shaped insects, giving off a very faint green glow. 120ft down the corridor is the [[Silent Spawner]]—a shadowy, bloated figure with green, glowing eyes. Each turn, it will create a new Sick Spawn. When a Sick Spawn explodes, the acid will instantly melt the stone in the adjacent tiles, revealing more of the cave to fight in. The floor will also be coated in acid. The acid can be cleared away by contact with water and will steam away without harming the players. When a creature ends their turn on a space coated in acid, they will take 1d6 acid damage. The Sick Spawn may come from behind the party as needed as they climb down from the ceiling.
## 5. Defeating the Silent Spawner 

When the players defeat the Silent Spawner, read the following out loud: 

*The shadowy figure melts into the ground, revealing another black hand mirror. After a brief pause, the hand mirror follows suit, melting into the ground. The passageway ahead continues deeper and starts to wind askew. The remaining Sick Spawn skitter of up the walls into the darkness above, and soon it is quiet. Silent.*

Heading deeper into the cave, the party will arrive at a large open room with tiered terraces along the side, similar to a large arena. Puddles of water cover the ground and the various terraces. When the players reach the room, read the following out loud: 

*The air grows frigid as you all step into this large chamber. Small puddles of water are scattered about the space. Natural terraces line the room with water trickling down the walls. In the silence and darkness, three pairs of glowing blue eyes appear at the far end of the room atop one of the terraces. Two of the figures leap down to ground level, and their misty shadowy forms begin to reveal equally shadowy weapons: a sword, a dagger, and for the one still in the back, a bow.*
## 6. [[Triple Threat]] 

The triple threats fight two at a time. On any given round, one of the creatures is immobilized and invulnerable. The one that is invulnerable loses the color in its eyes. This is an important clue for the players to identify which one they can attack. Each round, one of the triple threats will become invulnerable in this order: 

Archer → Aggressor → Assassin 

While immobilized and invulnerable, the respective creature will take no damage and also have its turn skipped. When the immobilized creature is attacked, the attack will pass harmlessly through its body. When one of them is defeated, the eyes will exchange between the remaining two, such that they immobilize on alternating turns. When there is only one triple threat left, it will immediately gain the blue eyes and never become immobilized.
## 7. Defeating the Triple Threat

After all three of the triple threats are slain, read the following out loud: 

*As the final shadowy figure falls, you watch as the shadow dissolves into the ground, its eyes still glowing as they settle onto the ground. The spot where the shadow falls grows dark, seemingly pulling in the darkness from the surrounding cave. The eyes begin to swirl and the dark spot spins like a whirlpool.* 

Beckoning. Challenging. The whirlpool is a portal to a mirror dimension where the mirror exists. When the party enters the portal, read the following out loud: 

*As you step into the whirlpool, you are overwhelmed with vertigo as the world around you begins to swirl. Without warning, you are standing in the cave again, with terraced rock, dry ground, and a faint tapping echoing in the darkness.*

As the party arrives through the portal, the tapping sound will intensify into the sound of footsteps. The footsteps sound like they are coming from far away through the far wall as if it did not exist. The battlefield is identical to the previous one for battle 3, but now seemingly devoid of water, and everything takes on a slightly more monochrome hue. A shadowy figure will walk through the wall to appear before the party, this one with blue eyes and what appears like four arms. It is wielding a bow in two of them, and a short sword and a golden hand mirror in the other two. Adjacent to the party, there are two more shadows that arise from the ground, one with red eyes and one with green eyes. This is the final boss fight.

## Final Boss Fight - Reflected Revenants

This boss fight incorporates the mechanics from the previous fights for a comprehensive final battle. During this fight, the Crimson Carver will take advantage of the darkness to dominate the battlefield. The Jade Jackal will spawn darkness to control the battlefield. The Gold Guard will primarily use ranged attacks to support the battlefield. The spawn from the Jade Jackal will create magical areas of darkness, unlike the Silent Spawner’s acid. Unlike the previous fight, only one creature will be vulnerable to damage at any given time. The blue eyes will move between the three of them in the following order: 

[[Gold Guard]] → [[Jade Jackal]] → [[Crimson Carver]]

When the creatures do not have the blue eyes, they will not take any damage, however they are still able to move and take actions as normal. Attacks against these creatures will pass through their shadowy bodies harmlessly. When one of them is defeated, the eyes will exchange between the remaining two, such that one always has the blue eyes. As soon as only one creature is left, they will inherit the blue eyes and become vulnerable to damage. If the Gold Guard is slain while either of the other two creatures are still alive, the mirror will fall into a nearby shadow and appear in the possession of either the Jade Jackal or the Crimson Carver. This will happen again until the mirror is in the possession of the last remaining creature.

When the final enemy is defeated, all the [[Jade Jackal Spawn]] and darkness will dissipate and you can read the following aloud:

*As the last creature collapses, the golden hand mirror clatters to the ground and the world around you shimmers and shatters. You are all returned to the familiar damp cave. It feels brighter than before.*
