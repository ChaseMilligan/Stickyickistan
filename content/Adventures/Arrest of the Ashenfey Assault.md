## The Fantastic Fireflies

Most inhabitants of [[The Ashenfey]] desire to hunt and slaughter in [[The Verdanfey]]. Failing that, they will settle for access to the creatures of the prime material. Good druids and fey are on guard against these incursions, fighting to protect their charges from the hunger of the corrupt. While gateways to the Verdanfey are usually far from the analogous gateways to the Ashenfey, in
some places they are close together. Such gateways are created by the people of the Ashenfey to make their incursions more convenient. One such pair of gateways exists in the [[Grim Forest]]. The Verdanfey gateway was created to allow good and neutral creatures to assist in containing the [[Green Miasma Zombies]] that threatened the woods. Afraid of missing out, [[Shadash]] created a gateway to her Ashenfey, sending evil creatures to assist in this operation. After the zombies were contained, the gates remained active. At first, a tense truce existed in the area. But all too soon the creatures of the Ashenfey crossed over on hunting expeditions. To counter this, the fey protecting the Verdanfey gate recruited [[Radiant Fantastic Fireflies]], fey swarms of radiant fireflies. These fireflies and their allies have limited the damage caused by the incursions from the Ashenfey, but the cost has been high.
## **Forest Gates**

There are two gates in the [[Grim Forest]]. One leads to [[The Verdanfey]] and the other to [[The Ashenfey]]. The gates, which are rough circles of stones, are permanently active. Using a gate just requires moving into and then out of the circle. Moving back into and then out of the circle reverses the process. For example, if a creature starts out on the prime material plane and enters the [[Verdanfey Gate]], it will enter the Verdanfey when it leaves the circle of stones. Returning to the circle and then leaving it will take them back to the prime material. The area around each gate is influenced by the fey realm it connects to, so the area around the Verdanfey gate is healthy and beautiful while the area around the [[Ashenfey Gate]] is sickly and greyish.
##### Verdanfey Gate Map
The plant and animal life around the gate are healthier and more robust than normal, thanks to the positive influence of the Verdanfey. There are also trees growing around the gate that are not native to the prime material plane. A DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check will reveal that the trees are from the Verdanfey.
##### Verdanfey Map
This is the other side of the gate. The Yellow trees are Radiant [[Elemental Trees]] and each is home to a swam of radiant butterflies or radiant fantastic fireflies. Geàrd Coille Boireann's house is located here. It is a living structure, growing up from the ground.
##### Ashenfey Gate Map
The area around the Ashenfey gate is tainted and corrupted by the negative energy of the Ashenfey. The plants are less healthy than elsewhere in the woods and natural animals instinctively avoid the area.
##### Ashenfey Map
This is the other side of the gateway. The Ashenfey is a grey and bleak place, the concentrated
manifestation of what most creatures would see as the negative aspects of the natural world.
The gate stones are surrounded by Necrotic Elemental Trees, each of which is the home to necrotic flies or [[Necrotic Fantastic Fireflies]]. Some of these trees can be the special Necrotic Trees that attack living creatures; the creatures of the Ashenfey avoid getting too close to those trees. Lusan’s hut, which is made from wood, bones, and tanned humanoid skins, is located on the hill.

## **On The Side Of The Verdanfey**

Geàrd will ask that [[Unit BH-Umbra Δ9]] slay the Ashenfey creatures in the forest, enter the Ashenfey and defeat Lusan, and then close the gate by destroying at least half the stones or removing at least half of them from the circle.
### 1. Battle At The Verdanfey Gate
Coincidentally, the gate will come under attack when the PCs depart The Verdanfey. The default attack will be four [[Ash Ticks]] hunting for deer. This can be adjusted for an easier or more challenging encounter. They will turn their attention from the deer to the PCs, attacking until destroyed.
### 2. Battle In The Woods
Rather than having a long grind of fighting the Ashenfey creatures, the PCs can have one battle in
the woods before reaching the Ashenfey gate. The other fighting will be done by Geard and her allies; the PCs can hear combat as they press towards the gate. But if the players enjoy a grind, more encounters can take place. The default battle in the woods pits the PCs against four [[Necroly-poly]] bugs, but this can be adjusted to make the fight easier or harder.
### 3. Battle At The Ashenfey gate
As Lusan sees herself as being on the offensive, she does not post guards at the gate. But when the PCs arrive, they will encounter three Ash Ticks and three Necro-poly bugs in the area. While the insects would happily eat each other, they much prefer the taste of prime material and Verdanfey creatures. As such, while they will not cooperate, they will focus on killing the PCs. Because of her philosophical views, Lusan will not assist the insects even if she is aware of the battle. Also, she knows that they are just as likely to go after her as the PCs, should she get close to them.
### 4. Battle In The Ashenfey
If the PCs enter the Ashenfey, they will initially encounter the necrotic fly swarms living in the
Necrotic Trees. The default attack consists of four swarms, this can be adjusted for difficulty. There can also be one or more of the Necrotic Elemental Trees that can sense and attack living creatures.
If Lusan notices the PCs entering the Ashenfey or trying to destroy the gate, she will move to confront them. In the default encounter, she will have four [[Seed Zombies]] and one swarm of fantastic necrotic fireflies with her. The difficulty can be increased slightly by adding more seed zombies or fireflies or increased substantially by adding the [[Shambling Mound]]. Unless the PCs immediately attack, Lusan will attempt to convince them to switch sides, promising them a suitable reward for their efforts. If they agree, she will send them on their way and await their
success or failure. If she cannot convince them to switch sides, she will try to persuade them to stay out of the fight, insisting that the battle is between her and [[Geàrd Coille Boireann]]. If the PCs leave, she will allow them to depart. If they refuse to leave or take hostile action, she will attack.
### 5. Destroying The Gate
A typical stone is AC 17 and takes 27 points of damage to destroy (enough damage to disrupt the
magic). If desired, the stone can be treated somewhat realistically as being immune to slashing and piercing damage from most handheld weapons (picks being an obvious exception).
If a stone is destroyed, it will emit a burst of necrotic energy in a 20-foot radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The typical stone weighs about 2,500 pounds, should the PCs decide to move them. If at least half the stones are moved (at least 40 feet away from all other stones) or destroyed, the gateway fails and closes.
### 6. Battle At The Verdanfey Gate (Optional)
The gate is guarded by a pack of six [[Guardian Wolves]] and a [[Guardian Bear]]. When the PCs attack, a
wolf will be sent to warn Geard. If the guardians are killed before they can warn Geard, the PCs might be able to catch her by surprise.
### 7. Battle In The Verdanfey (Optional)
If the PCs enter the Verdanfey and are engaged in hostilities, they will be attacked by the radiant
butterfly swarms living in the Radiant Trees. The default attack consists of four swarms, this can be
adjusted for difficulty. There can also be one or more of the special Radiant Trees that can sense and attack living creatures. Unless the PCs immediately attack, Geard will attempt to convince them to stay on her side, promising them she is a better Ally than Lusan. If they agree, she will send them on their way and await their success or failure. If she cannot convince them to stay on her side, she will try to persuade them to stay out of the fight, insisting that the battle is between her and the [[Lusan Boireann Olc]], and she never should have asked in the first place. She will also refuse pay. If the PCs leave, she will allow them to depart. If they refuse to leave or take hostile action, she will attack.
