# General:

- The [[Gilded Nug]] was successfully retrieved by the squad and [[Wes Scantlin]] was defeated once and for all
- [[Ashen Shadow Society]] info tech’s were able to use some info from [[Fungi]] when he returned, and the company scrying system to direct an Airship to the Gapejaw Bog to look for the squad or their remains
- Upon their return to the [[Ashen Citadel]], the squad is escorted to a managerial part of the Citadel where they are given [[A.S.S sending stones]], and codes that allow them to access new areas of the citadel
- The new areas they can access are [[The Rusted Chalice]], The Airship Hangar, and A [[Combat Training Facility]]
- They are informed of their successful probation period, and promotion from a Novice Squad to Bloodhounds of A.S.S. During this time, some tech’s have been sent to their quarters to upgrade/install things to match their new rank.
- Since they are out of probation they are officially given their guild mandated USID (unique squad identifier) which is [[Unit BH-Umbra Δ9]]
- They each receive 3000gp and use 1500gp each to fund the upgrades to their quarters
- Within a few days, the lab tech’s are able to decipher the ancient allegory about the Gilded Nug, and they discover that the gilded nug can be broken down using a magical grinder, and rolled in magical gilded hemp leaf to make 3 [[Gilded Blunt]]s. These 3 blunts hold immense magical power, and allow anyone that smokes them to use the Wish spell before it turns to ash
- These blunts will be given to the party when it is deemed necessary
- When they return to their quarters, it looks mostly the same, and still smells like unfettered butt musk, but it feels a bit larger. A few mushrooms are propped against the wall in a dim corner, and some new machines have been placed along the wall next to an upgraded alchemy table. They have also added some decor around the room. Mostly utility things like a large chest for storage and some shelving units.
# Ideas:

- Make a scenario where they go to the shopping district to use their new money, and while they are there, they get attacked by a squad of rival bounty hunters from THC that are trying to kill them for the money that Hazeus Tokenheim put on their heads.
- Make a mission where they are asked to help Fungi get rid of his bug brain curse by going through a custom made trial in the combat training facility
- The combat training facility is a giant magitech machine that is capable of simulating realistic, fully interactive environments, and creatures of all kinds. If a bounty hunter is to drop to 0HP in the combat training facility, and they fail death saves, they are immediately transported out of the machine and wake up in the Citadel infirmary with a minimum 2 levels of exhaustion. They are able to rejoin their squad in the training mission, or bow out of the exercise.
- Two kinds of Arcannabis seeds:
- Pre-enchanted seeds are seeds purchased from a licensed grower with stable genetics. This means the effects of the plant it will grow are already known and are guaranteed to be correct. Pre-enchanted seeds will take only a month of in game time to finish, and they will produce enough for 3 joints/blunts/bowls
- Virgin Seeds are wild seeds that have been procured from the Outback, and need to be enchanted before they can be planted. If they are planted without being enchanted first, there is only a 25% chance (DC16 Nature) it will produce Arcannabis, and the effect will be a random cantrip. The other 75% of the seeds will be non-magical cannabis. To enchant a Virgin seed, all materials used in the spell being used in the enchantment must be sacrificed along with (1d4 + spell level x 10) gp. Seeds can be harvested from the plant a Virgin seed produces, and a DC 13 Nature(Wisdom) check will determine if the genetics have been stabilized or not. The number of generations the strain has gone through can be added to the Nature check. For example if they enchant a seed, plant it, harvest seeds from the plant instead of flowers, and fail the Nature check, the new seeds they harvested will add a +1 to the nature roll. If they fail the Nature check a second time the newest seeds will add a +2 to the Nature roll.

# Fungi:

Fungi was spotted on the ASS scrying system just outside city limits hauling ass through the forest. [[Zara Blackthorn]] was informed and sent a Novice squad to go get him. When they eventually found him, he was on the industrial side of town sifting through a bunch of waste material from a hemp paper processing plant. When asked what happened and why he wasn’t with his party he spoke incoherently, and it became obvious to the rescue party that Fungi is now suffering from an insect infestation in his body. This affects him in a few ways:

- Disadvantage on Concentration Checks: The constant movement of bugs makes it hard to maintain focus during spellcasting.
- Damage Over Time: At the start of each long rest, they must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage as the bugs bite into their body. This damage cannot be reduced by resistance.
- Distracting Noise: The constant buzzing and skittering causes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on hearing.
- Spell Interference: The bugs occasionally disrupt the [[Warforged]]’s druidic magic. When casting a spell, they must roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the spell fizzles and is wasted.
- This infestation can be dispelled with a wish spell or greater restoration.

Zara will also have Fungi be brought in to chew him out for abandoning the mission, and letting him know that for this fuck up he now has 2 of 3 strikes against him during his probation period in the guild. A third strike will result in him being permanently assigned to the Ashen Support Squad (a fate that most likely means he will die on a mission way out of his depth). A third strike will be given based on Zara’s own discretion.

# The Rusted Chalice:

The Rusted Chalice is where all the ranked squads can go to socialize. Imagine a medieval tavern and a hookah lounge from 3005 fucked and gave birth to the Rusted Chalice. Scantily clad droid waitresses serve the patrons seated at tables and booths, and a [[Warforged]] with elf-like features stands behind the bar named [[C0B4LT]]. The bar serves [[Zooka Malt]] and some hard spirits made from [[Arcannabis]].
## Side Quest NPC’s:

### [[Kezrin Malvek]]
### [[Velindra Ashveil]]

# Airship Port & Hangar Bay:

The Hangar Bay is where ASS keeps their fleet of airships, and services them when they need maintenance. The Airship Port is an opulent deck off the side of the citadel over the city streets below where the company Airships leave from and incoming Airships are received.
# Squad Quarters:

The squad’s quarters have been fitted with some new decor, and tools to help the party. First off the tech’s updated the software version of their BPU ([[Bounty Processing Unit]]) which has a nicer looking UI, and access to info the old system wasn’t capable of getting from the [[Ashen Archives]]. Secondly they have installed an alchemy/herbology station where [[Xon]] can use their alchemy skills to make potions, and enchant seeds, and there is a rudimentary setup for [[Arcannabis Cultivation]].
# Arcane Healers:

### [[Arcana Belle]]

# THC Rivals:

## [[Sizzle Scorchmane]]

## [[Sir Ashwyn Highblade]]

## [[Solmenda]]

## [[Thistlebog]]

# [[Tribunal Highblade Coalition]] Encounter:

[[Dusk Flame VII]] will set up an ambush on the party in the downtown area. When the time feels right, have the THC squad minus Thistlebog, and Ashwyn roll a group stealth. If it is low enough, a PC’s passive perception may be able to spot them. If they get spotted before they can enact the ambush plan with Thistlebog waiting on a rooftop up ahead, describe to the party what they see:

You turn around and notice a trio of individuals a fair distance back that stand out from the regular crowd of commoners. A tall blonde woman in a flowing flower dress with a sigil adorned staff, and a Red [[Dragonborn]] wearing high quality armor with a sword at his waist. You keep walking for a moment, and realize they are following you.

If the party makes it obvious that they have spotted the duo of THC members, and or try approaching them, Sizzle will contact Thistlebog with a sending stone to call off the plan, and Solmeda will use her [[Sigil Bound Gate Band]] to get them away, and their ambush plans have been foiled. 

As you make it clear that you have seen your pursuers, in an instant, you see the dragonborn grab something from a pouch on his waist and speak into it while the tall blonde woman traces a circular sigil in the air. In an instant, she completes the somatic motion, and they are encircled by a ring of spectral sigils at the waist. The sigil rings collapse on them and they vanish in front of your eyes.

If the THC members go unnoticed, they will tail the party to the location where Thistlebog, and Ashwyn lie in wait.

When the party is in Thistlebog’s range, have all PC’s make a perception check. This perception check must beat a stealth roll from Thistlebog. Thistlebog will be attempting to hide on a nearby stair accessible rooftop. If any PC’s are able to spot him, they will notice him looking directly at whoever is the closest target for him to hit, mutter something to himself, then pull out a blowgun and green-tipped needles. Roll initiative. If the PC’s are unable to spot him, Thistlebog will cast his hunter’s mark on the closest target, and then shoot them with his blowgun, and signal his squad via sending stone to move in for the kill. Roll Initiative. Ashwyn, and Thistlebog will have 6 temp HP to start the fight due to Sir Ashwyn’s Inspiring leader feat. At any point during the fight, if any of the THC members are mortally threatened, Solmenda will use her Sigil Bound Gate Band to teleport them all out of the fight. During the fight Sizzle, and Ashwyn will intro themselves like fucking anime villains explaining a little about who they are, and why they are trying to kill the party. 

*"It’s just business. You understand."*

This encounter either ends in a TPK, THC squad teleporting away at the last second, or they somehow figure out how to stop Solmenda from teleporting them away to safety, and the THC are eliminated. If they eliminate the THC squad, the price on their head will raise to 1000gp each, and another stronger squad will come after them.
# [[Puffer's Pottery]]:

[[Wererats]] [[The Plague Plugz]] Gang  

You walk in and smell the strong smell of arcannabis smoke. A slender man stands behind the counter, and the walls are lined with clay pots of varying quality.

Have each PC make a DC 10 Perception to see the thieves can’t on the wall when they walk in

A DC 12 Perception will see the metal box under the counter, and the fact that the man behind the counter isn’t smoking.

Puffer is behind the counter. When the party walks in, he will say nothing, just look them up and down with a bit of a puzzled look, and then look up at the thieves can’t above the curtain. All PC’s will notice. If they don’t ask anything about it he will try to quickly sell them some pottery for very cheap and get them out the door. If they do inquire about poison, or bring up the thieves can’t, he will say:

Two at a time.

Then he will walk slowly over to the curtain and pull it to the side, motioning them into the next room. When the  party has decided who they are sending in Puffer will say:

The stairs are just over there…

From here it should be pretty straightforward.

The staircase leads to a dimly lit room with the smell of stale tobacco smoke and bad body odor enters your nostrils as you descend the stairs. The room is dimly lit with candles supplementing the lack of light. Barrels and crates line the walls to keep a main pathway open. A large table pushed against the wall has a multitude of colored bottles and folded paper envelopes lining the

edges of the table.
# Next Session:

Next session will start on the airship they were scooped up in at the end of the last session, on the way to the Citadel. Go over what is in the General section above. From there, the party will have some options that they can do in any order. 
## Intro:

1. The opening scene will be the party and Zara sans Fungi returning to the Ashen Citadel airship port. Light RP conversations about the last session.
2. As they converse about the fall of Wes Scantlin, Zara walks them from the airship port to her office where Fungi is waiting.
3. When they get to her office, explain Fungi’s infestation, how they found him, the [[A.S.S sending stones]], and payment for the mission, which they all already have on their sheets. Also explain the changes made to Wraith and Baeriggs magic items they purchased from BBB in the first session. Apologize cause you done fucked up by not realizing they weren’t finished for the first session since you worked on it so long ago.
4. Explain that Fungi must complete a mandatory disciplinary combat training exercise before they are allowed to take on any new work.
5. After this, tell them that their quarters are being renovated for the next few hours, so they should go find somewhere else to hang out in the meantime. This would be a good time to bring up [[The Rusted Chalice]] that they can also go check out now. It is about 3:00 pm at this point though, so there isn’t anyone there other than [[C0B4LT]], and [[Kezrin Malvek]] until later. Zara will mention it likely won’t be busy, but it’s open 24/7.
6. Zara will say, if they head downtown to go shopping, there is also a magi-mediclinic run by a trusted acquaintance, [[Arcana Belle]], that will be able to cure Fungi’s infestation without a hitch.
7. They are also free to complete Fungi’s disciplinary combat training exercise at any time.
## Shopping:

Ask which shops they are going to. Any Shop they can go to other than BBB is downtown. If they go to [[Blunts Blades and Bongs]], group DC 12 stealth or intimidation, or they encounter [[Cough City Thugs]] when they leave since to get to [[Bongstad]] you must go through [[Upper South Booftown]] CCC territory. If they go to [[The Green Grimoire]], on the way there, have each PC make a Perception roll. On a 12, Baeriggs will notice that as they pass a particular store, [[Puffer's Pottery]], the sign has some writing in a language he vaguely knows that isn’t Dwarvish or Common. On a 14, anyone can notice the person behind the counter of this store has some suspiciously rat-like features like the tip of a tail poking out of their pants, and hair in strange places. If they decide to go in, refer to the [[Puffer's Pottery]] section of the document.

Any other shops they can shop in peace. After they are done shopping, they will get ambushed by [[Dusk Flame VII]], the bounty hunting squad that Hazeus Tokenheim hired to kill them. When they finally return to the Citadel, their quarters will be finished, and accessible again. Here is where to introduce the new BPU system. However, they can’t use it until they have completed Fungi’s disciplinary combat training exercise. Here they can do the following if they have yet to complete them, and meet the requirements to do them:

1. Fungi’s disciplinary combat training exercise
2. Kezrin’s Giant Centipede Hunt
3. Return to the Rusted Chalice
4. See Arcana Belle
5. See Vindra Stitch
6. Go to bed I guess lol
7. Do something completely unexpected lmao

## Fungi’s Disciplinary Combat Training Exercise:

This section is just a run through four combat scenarios that get increasingly harder. The party can benefit from a short rest between each simulation.

### 1. Ankheg’s Nest - MD
- 3 Ankheg
- 3 [[Necrotic Fly swarms]]
### 2. Arachnid Assault - HD
- 6 Spiders
- 1 Phase Spider
- 3 [[Ash Ticks]]
- 1 [[Necroly-poly]]
### 3. Kraul Frontlines - HD
- 4 Kraul Warriors
- 2 Winged Kraul Warriors
- 1 Kraul Death Priest
### 4. Mothman - DD
- 1 [[Mothman]]
- 2 [[Aberrant Moths]]
## Kezrin’s Giant Centipede Hunt:

This is a small encounter where the party accompanies Kezrin into the Outback. He leads them to a place where he knows there will be plenty of Giant Centipedes. The PC’s and Kezrin will encounter 8 Giant Centipedes in a clearing or on a path in the Outback not too far outside the city. This combat should be trivial for them.
