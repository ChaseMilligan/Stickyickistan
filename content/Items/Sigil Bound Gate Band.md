[DDB Item](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9597263-sigil-bound-gateway-band)

This ring is a gold band with a unique sigil combination inscribed on the band. The unique sigil combination is the same combination of sigils used to create the [Teleportation Circle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619167-teleportation-circle), and links the ring to it. While attuned to this ring, and within at least 250sq km of the linked Teleportation Circle, as an action or reaction to a friendly creature being hit, the wearer can choose up to three other willing non-incapacitated creatures that they can see, and activate the ring by tracing a circular sigil in the air. If the ring is activated as an action, the wearer immediately teleports to a safe space within 5ft of the linked Teleportation Circle, or the next closest safe space. Each creature they targeted with the ring becomes encircled by a spectral ring of the unique sigil combination, and is teleported within 5ft of the Teleportation Circle, or the next closest safe space at the beginning of their next turn provided they stay above 0 hp. If the ring is used as a reaction to a friendly creature getting hit, the wearer can choose to immediately teleport the friendly creature within 5ft of the Teleportation Circle, or the next closest safe space before they are hit, and wait until the start of their own next turn to be teleported within 5ft of the Teleportation Circle, or the next closest safe space provided they stay above 0 hp. If used out of combat, all targeted creatures are immediately teleported within 5ft of the Teleportation Circle, or the next closest safe space. This cannot be done again until the wearer has long rested.

The sigils inscribed on the ring can be removed by casting [Mending](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619033-mending) on it, which turns it back into a non-magical gold band. Any gold ring can be used to create a Sigil Bound Gateway Band. First you must have a Teleportation Circle. Then you need to engrave the unique sigil combination of the teleportation circle into the band which can be done with a DC 13 sleight of hand check, or the use of [Jeweler's Tools](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/423-jewelers-tools). If the sleight of hand check is failed, they can cast Mending on it and try again. After the sigils have been engraved, the ring must be brought within 5ft of the Teleportation Circle every day for a month to become linked.
