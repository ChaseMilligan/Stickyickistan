# **Exiled Pirate Clan** - 500gp

A group of exiled humans formed a pirate clan based out of a [wooden fort](https://www.patreon.com/posts/viking-fort-free-111730218) called [[Blacktide's Fort]] they built upon a coastal cliffside. They were involved in the murder of a nobleman, and the sacking of his ship that was carrying a large amount of freight and gold. The nobleman's family has put a bounty on the head of the captain of the pirate clan. Collect proof of the captains death, and you will be rewarded. If you can bring the Pirate captain back alive, the reward will be doubled. Part of the reward is the 250gp that was stolen from the ship which can be found at the fort, and the rest of the reward can be collected at [House Varkos' Manor](https://www.patreon.com/posts/gothic-mansion-92033269).
### [[House Varkos]] (Noble Family)

The assassination of [[Lord Taron Varkos]]—who was slain aboard his personal galleon, the Golden Wake, during a daring nighttime assault—has thrown the family into a vendetta. The cargo aboard his ship, including a fortune in gold and a cache of priceless artifacts, was looted by The Drowned Brotherhood. Now, the Varkos family has placed a reasonable bounty on Captain [[Svarog 'Blacktide' Valesk]] head. Lord Taron Varkos was a quite elderly man
#### Notable Members:

- **[[Lady Elessara Varkos]] ("The Widow")** – The late Lord Taron’s widow, who now leads the family with an iron grip. She is the Lord's second wife, and significantly younger than the late Lord. Closer to his sons age.
- **[[Sir Davrik Varkos]]** – The eldest son, a battle-hardened knight and commander of the family's privateer fleet, sworn to avenge his father.
### Hostiles

- [**Captain Svarog "Black-Tide" Valesk**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4904838-pirate-captain) – The brutal and cunning leader of [[The Drowned Brotherhood]]. He was exiled from his homeland after leading a mutiny against his former lord. His blackened, sea-ravaged armor and the shark-tooth medallion around his neck make him an imposing figure.
- **Blacktide's Bride Zyssara Bloodtide** (Sahuagin Priestess)
- 2 x [Pirates](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4904830-pirate), Red and Marko
- 12 x [Commoners](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194951-commoner)

### Loot

Many fine wares from [[The Drowned Brotherhood]]'s recent raid of [[House Varkos]]' ship the Golden Wake can be found throughout the fort. Some things like dinnerware, and bedding have clearly been replaced by items of a much higher quality, and the stolen 250gp can be found on the desk in the captain's quarters.

Investigation or Perception DC 10 in any of the buildings and the squad finds a burlap sack containing a quarter pound of [[Fizzlebud]]. This is enough to kill a [[Halflings]] commoner, and make 96 joints (uses) , or one standard size barrel of [[Zooka Malt]].

If they succeed a DC 13 investigation check in the captain's quarters, they can roll the jewelry table below once for each person that investigates.

}
```
### Twist

If the party investigates the Captain's quarters of the fort, with a DC 15 investigation they find a piece of parchment on a desk. This piece of parchment is proof that Lady Elessara Varkos paid the pirate clan to kill her husband. She gave the pirates their voyage plan so they could conveniently intercept the Varkos ship near an island where she would escape to and await rescue. She promised them the ship would be full of valuables and gold for them to take as long as they let her live.
#### Sinister Letter

> Captain,
> 
> As discussed, I entrust this correspondence to your discretion, for the benefit of all involved. My husband’s ship, _The Golden Wake_, will depart from Varkos Harbor on the eve of the new moon, its course set for the trade isle of [[Ravensport]]. Its route will take it within a day's sail of the isle of [[Blackreef]], an opportunity that I trust you will seize upon.
> 
> The ship will be well-laden with treasures—gold, silks, [[Arcannabis]], and artifacts of no small value. In return for your discretion and efficiency in eliminating Lord Taron Varkos, I offer you and your men free rein over its contents. Take what you will. Let there be no survivors save for myself. I will be awaiting retrieval at the cove on the eastern shore of Blackreef, as arranged.
> 
> Ensure there are no traces that could lead back to me. The tides must wash away all suspicion. Once my husband’s unfortunate demise is confirmed, House Varkos will be mine to command, and there will be more lucrative opportunities ahead for those who prove themselves useful.
> 
> Do not disappoint me, Captain.
> 
> E. Varkos
### Resolution

They will be greeted out front of the manor of [[House Varkos]] by [[Sir Davrik Varkos]] who has their reward.
#### Dead Captain

If the squad kills the captain they must bring something valuable of his back to [[House Varkos]] to prove he is in fact dead. This could be literally his head, the head of his sahuagin wife Zyssara Bloodtide, the captain's necklace, or his sword. If they come up with something more creative go with that.
#### Alive Captain

If the squad somehow manages to capture the captain alive, and return him to [[House Varkos]], some noble guards will take him away, and [[Sir Davrik Varkos]] will hand them 500gp, and ask them for a moment to fetch the rest since they brought him in alive.
#### Fin

Regardless of the captain's state of being, if the squad does not find [[Lady Elessara Varkos]]' note, [[Sir Davrik Varkos]] will ask the party how he can keep in touch with the squad in case he needs their services. He will express some suspicions he has about his step-mother. If they care to keep in touch, the squad can tell him to contact the [[Ashen Shadow Society]] and ask for [[Unit BH-Umbra Δ9]].

# **Swarm Swarm on the Range** - 350gp

A land lord named [[Ezra Astallon]] from [[North Booftown]] will pay 200gp to anyone that can kill a swarm of [[Mycoforged]] from the [[Zooka Mire Collective]] that has wandered out of the Mire and onto some [farmland](https://www.czepeku.com/windmill-farm/swamp-day). They are destroying crops, and property of the lord and his commoners. Once the swarm has been dealt with, they can go to Ezra's [manor](https://www.patreon.com/posts/governors-free-119792589).
### Hostiles

- 6 x [Lesser Mycoforged](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5185387-lesser-mycoforged)
- 4 x [Swarm of Mechanical Spiders](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/285351-swarm-of-mechanical-spiders)
- 1 x [Greater Mycoforged](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5221781-greater-mycoforged)
### Resolution

When the party defeats the hostiles they can walk a short distance to the mansion of [[Ezra Astallon]] to collect their reward. While collecting the reward, Ezra will ask the squad if they like to party. He will explain he has an exquisite ballroom in his mansion that he often uses to host parties for [[Stickyickistan]]'s elite. If they would like, he can extend them an invitation to the next one. 

# Vanquish the Vermin - 125gp

An upper middle class couple that live in the Bobo bush estates have reported the presence of Wererats in the neighborhood. They have brought this up with their HOA, but they have yet to do anything about it. People all around the area have reported things going missing from their yards, and one family experienced a break and enter. There is a manhole in the street that the Wererats retreat in to every morning before light after their raiding is done. Enter the sewers and slay the Wererats for the reward. We do not care to see them alive ever again.
### Scenarios

If the party goes during the day, the wererats are in their [sewer hideout](https://www.czepeku.com/sewer-tunnels/original-day) beneath Bobo bush estates. If they go at night, they find the manhole is open, and with a DC 10 perception they can see the door to one of the [houses](https://discord.com/channels/1218314154125955092/1218314154721673248/1338987220568244248) on the street has been broken open. The wererats are inside looting the first floor while the residents sleep upstairs.
### Hostiles
- 2 x [Wererat Rangers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/259891-thieves-guild-wererat)
- 2 x [Wererats](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195265-wererat)
### Resolution

When the wererats have been slain, the party can travel to house number 420 on the same street. This is the home of the head of the HOA. They will be scared shitless to see the squad at their doorstep, quickly toss them the gold and slam the door.
