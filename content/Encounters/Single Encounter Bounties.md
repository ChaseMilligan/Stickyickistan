# **Exiled Pirate Clan** - 500gp

A group of exiled humans formed a pirate clan based out of a [wooden fort](https://www.patreon.com/posts/viking-fort-free-111730218) called [[Blacktide's Fort]] they built upon a coastal cliffside. They were involved in the murder of a nobleman, and the sacking of his ship that was carrying a large amount of freight and gold. The nobleman's family has put a bounty on the head of the captain of the pirate clan. Collect proof of the captains death, and you will be rewarded. If you can bring the Pirate captain back alive, the reward will be doubled.
### **[[House Varkos]]** (Noble Family)

The assassination of Lord Taron Varkos—who was slain aboard his personal galleon, the Golden Wake, during a daring nighttime assault—has thrown the family into a vendetta. The cargo aboard his ship, including a fortune in gold and a cache of priceless artifacts, was looted by The Drowned Brotherhood. Now, the Varkos family has placed a reasonable bounty on Captain [[Svarog 'Blacktide' Valesk]] head.
#### **Notable Members:**

- **Lady Elessara Varkos ("The Widow")** – The late Lord Taron’s widow, who now leads the family with an iron grip.
- **Sir Dravik Varkos** – The eldest son, a battle-hardened knight and commander of the family's privateer fleet, sworn to avenge his father.
### Hostiles

- [**Captain Svarog "Black-Tide" Valesk**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4904838-pirate-captain) – The brutal and cunning leader of [[The Drowned Brotherhood]]. He was exiled from his homeland after leading a mutiny against his former lord. His blackened, sea-ravaged armor and the shark-tooth medallion around his neck make him an imposing figure.

# Vanquish the Vermin - 125gp

An upper middle class couple that live in the Bobo bush estates have reported the presence of Wererats in the neighborhood. They have brought this up with their HOA, but they have yet to do anything about it. People all around the area have reported things going missing from their yards, and one family experienced a break and enter. There is a manhole in the street that the Wererats retreat in to every morning before light after their raiding is done. Enter the sewers and slay the Wererats for the reward. We do not care to see them alive ever again.
### Scenarios

If the party goes during the day, the wererats are in their [sewer hideout](https://www.czepeku.com/sewer-tunnels/original-day) beneath Bobo bush estates. If they go at night, they find the manhole is open, and with a DC 10 perception they can see the door to one of the [houses](https://discord.com/channels/1218314154125955092/1218314154721673248/1338987220568244248) on the street has been broken open. The wererats are inside looting the first floor while the residents sleep upstairs.
