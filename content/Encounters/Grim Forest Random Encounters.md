| **1**   | A [treant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17037-treant) stands motionless, its bark blackened with decay. As the party approaches, it awakens and attacks, summoning a [swarm of rot grubs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560935-swarm-of-rot-grubs) from within its hollowed chest.                                                                                                                  |
| **2**   | A pair of [wights](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17059-wight) patrol the ruins of an overgrown settlement, muttering fragments of their past lives. If disturbed, they attack, summoning 2d4 [zombies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17077-zombie) from the ground.                                                                                                                                   |
| **3**   | A [specter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17017-specter) drifts through the trees, appearing as a lost traveler. If engaged, it asks the party to carry its bones to a hidden shrine deep in the forest. If refused, it attacks with two shadow allies.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **4**   | A [flesh golem](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16863-flesh-golem), stitched together from the bodies of past victims, wanders the forest searching for "new parts." It is accompanied by two [crawling claws](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17139-crawling-claw), which skitter in the undergrowth.                                                                                                    |
| **5**   | The party comes across an enormous, ancient tree covered in strange runes. A [blighted dryad](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/355228-blight-dryad) that has merged with an [awakened tree](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16792-awakened-tree) emerges and warns them to leave. If they refuse, she calls upon 2d4 [awakened shrubs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16791-awakened-shrub) to attack. |
| **6**   | The party encounters a thick, green fog rolling through the forest. If they linger, they must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. Hiding in the mist are two [will-o’-wisps](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1979814-will-o-wisp-variant) that strike when the party is weak.                                                                                            |
| **7**   | A [wraith](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17064-wraith) emerges from a long-forgotten ruin, followed by three [shadows](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1979804-shadow-variant) that slither along the ground, seeking warmth to steal.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **8**   | A [blight-infested treant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1300424-blighted-treant) watches over a corrupted glade. When approached, four [vine blights](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17216-vine-blight) burst from the undergrowth, ensnaring the unwelcome.                                                                                                                                          |
| **9**   | A ruined battlefield is littered with rusted weapons and armor. Disturbing anything awakens 1d6 [armored skeletons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/187940-armored-skeleton) and a [minotaur skeleton](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16959-minotaur-skeleton), all reliving their final moments of war.                                                                                                 |
| **10**  | A massive, withered tree in the center of the path has faces embedded in its bark that whisper secrets of the past. Listening too long causes the party to succeed a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d6 psychic damage as the voices claw at their minds. A banshee haunts the tree’s roots, attacking those who seek too much knowledge.                                                                    |
| **11**  | A disguised [green hag](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16911-green-hag) in a crumbling cottage offers the party soup made from questionable ingredients. If accepted, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours. If they refuse, she summons three [scarecrows](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17200-scarecrow) to attack.                                            |
| **12**  | A [beholder zombie](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17111-beholder-zombie), once a powerful mage in Spliffholm, drifts through the ruins, whispering about its lost kingdom. If provoked, it unleashes its eyestalks in a fit of madness.                                                                                                                                                                    |
