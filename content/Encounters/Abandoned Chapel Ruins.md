This encounter can be initiated in a few ways. [[Velindra Ashveil]] can give them information about this location for 100gp, alternatively they may come across it while travelling in the [[Grim Forest]] through [[The Outback]]. Just off the main road through the Grim Forest is a hidden path that can be seen with a DC 16 Perception check. This path leads to the ruins of an abandoned chapel from before [[Human Colonialism]]. These ruins are now inhabited by a cult of [[Halflings]] that worship [[Shadash]] ([[Acolytes of Shadash]]). They believe they have a spiritual connection to the chapel, and their ancestors who they claim once worshipped here. If the PC's inspect the chapel walls, there are verses etched into the stone walls above doorways, and an altar that clearly show those who built the chapel venerated Shadash. A DC 13 Religion check will allow the PC more info about Shadash if they know nothing. The acolytes do not take kindly to outsiders especially if they aren't Halflings, and will not hesitate to strike. There are six acolytes at the chapel, and they are using the basement of the chapel to store:
- 133gp
- 2 rubies worth ~25gp
- 1 diamond worth ~100gp
- 278sp
- 507cp
- and a bunch of handmade jewelry adorning symbols of Shadash worth ~0. 

The acolytes can be reasoned with, and just want to be left alone to rebuild the chapel, but they do plan on spreading death and decay in the surrounding area.
