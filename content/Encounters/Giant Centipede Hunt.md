This encounter can be initiated in a few ways. The PC's could be accompanying [[Kezrin Malvek]] on his task to collect Giant Centipede venom for [[The Plague Plugz]], or the PC's may have been asked to do the same task by them. Either way they will have to go into [[The Outback]] and find some Giant Centipedes. If they have Kezrin with them, he already knows where a bunch are. If they go by themselves, at least one PC must succeed a DC 13 Nature, or Survival check to track down some Giant Centipedes. They will end up in a clearing of the woods surrounded by high terraced stone walls. Here there are about 8 Giant Centipedes. They know that The Plague Plugz will buy a vial of venom for 100gp, or Kezrin asks them to help him fill 3 vials. To collect venom from a Giant Centipede, you need access to it's fangs, and it must be unable to attack, whether it is dead, grappled, stunned, etc. Kezrin can show them how to properly extract the venom from the fangs of a giant insect (this will also work on Giant Spiders and the like), or they can try to Succeed a DC 14 Nature check to flex the creatures mandibles while holding a vial beneath its fang. Each creature has enough venom to fill one vial. If the creature is not dead, it will regenerate the venom naturally in an hour.
