**Zahur al-Nasira**

[Sheet](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/141830447)

*The Azure Storm, He Who Whispers to the Winds*

A being of tempestuous laughter and boundless charisma, **Zahur al-Nasira** is more than just a Djinni Prince—he is the **Master of Mayhem**, the **Architect of Anarchy**, and the **Undisputed Host** of the most exhilarating game show in all the multiverse: **The League of Labyrinthia!**

### **Personality & Presence**

Zahur is a being of contradictions—a jovial yet ruthless ruler, a playful yet cunning trickster. His voice is a symphony of howling winds and thunderclaps, rising and falling with the tension of the game. He takes great delight in watching contestants squirm, but he respects true cunning and bravery, rewarding those who dare to face the odds with skill.

From his floating storm-palace [[Nasirath]], the Citadel of Endless Skies, Zahur orchestrates each event with meticulous chaos, ensuring that no two games are ever the same. He thrives on the energy of the crowd, feeding off their cheers and gasps as they witness heroes rise and fall.

### **Appearance & Attire**

Zahur’s form is as mutable as the winds. His body shimmers between solid and ethereal, his deep blue skin streaked with arcs of crackling lightning. His robes, woven from storm clouds and embroidered with golden filigree, billow even when there is no breeze. A crown of swirling mist and gemstones sits atop his head, and his piercing silver eyes gleam with mischief and wisdom.

### **The Legend of Zahur**

Long ago, Zahur was a prince among the Djinn, a noble spirit of air and sky. But his thirst for entertainment, his love for chaos, and his insatiable desire to shape the fates of mortals led him to carve out a realm of his own—an arena where destiny itself is rewritten with every roll of the dice. His power is bound not by laws, but by spectacle; so long as his League thrives, so too does his dominion over the unpredictable.

Adventurers come seeking fame, fortune, or even a wish from the Djinni Prince himself. But beware—Zahur grants no favors freely. In the League of Labyrinthia, the only sure thing is that nothing is ever certain.
