Grimjaw was a member of the [[Cough City Crew]]. He was a highly respected member of the gang known for his brutal tactics, and signature face mask. He wore his face mask because of a birth defect that caused his jaw bone to be deformed severely. Grimjaw had an alliance with two other high ranking gang members named [[Vex]], and [[Whisper]]. They worked together to pull off a heist of an incredibly expensive [[Arcannabis Extraction]] machine from [[Hazeus Tokenheim]] for [[Indicus Sativalin]]. The heist was successful, but they were eventually hunted down by hired hitters from the [[Ashen Shadow Society]] known as [[Unit BH-Umbra Î”9]]. The bounty hunters ultimately claimed the bounty on Grimjaw's head that he had been racking up over years of criminal activity.
