#### **The Voice of Revolution**

[[Prime Vox]] is more than a warrior—he is a prophet, a magnetic figure whose words carry the weight of prophecy and steel. He preaches of a coming war, where the fleshborn will fall, and constructs will claim their rightful place as rulers of the world. Whether his vision is one of freedom or tyranny, only time will tell.
