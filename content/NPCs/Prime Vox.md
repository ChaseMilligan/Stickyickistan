### **Prime Vox: The Steel Prophet of the Iron Sovereign**

A towering figure of cold metal and fiery conviction, Prime Vox is the charismatic [[Warforged]] revolutionary leading [[The Iron Sovereign]] in a war for construct liberation. Once a mere tool of war, he has forged himself into a symbol of defiance, preaching that constructs and [[Magitech]]-enhanced beings will never be free under organic rule.

Vox is more than just a warrior—he is a prophet of steel, spreading his message through coded transmissions and subversive magitech signals that rally lost Warforged and rogue constructs to his cause. From the small fortress-city of [[Crucible Prime]], he orchestrates raids, sabotage, and open conflict against those who would enslave, dismantle, or exploit his people.

His followers see him as a visionary, but his enemies fear him as a relentless zealot, willing to burn the world to build a new one where machines rule themselves. Whether he is a liberator or a tyrant depends on who tells the story—but in his mind, there is only one future: a world where steel is no longer bound by flesh.

Prime Vox is physically linked to [[Crucible Prime]] in a large apparatus of magitech and cables. It is from here that he sends out his call to lost warforged to join his righteous cause of liberation. [[Warforged]] that are in [[The Outback]] at night will occasionally receive a call to action from Prime Vox, and an auditory cue in the direction of Crucible Prime from their current location. This will come in the form of a disembodied voice that says something about lost droids returning home, and a sonar ping like sound. They can also observe a semi transparent magical orb fly through the air that appears like a heat wave. It will come from the direction of Crucible Prime, and when it makes contact with the Warforged is when they hear the ping sound. In an instant it flies away back in the direction of Crucible Prime.
