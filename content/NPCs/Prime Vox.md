### **Prime Vox: The Steel Prophet of the Iron Sovereign**

A towering figure of cold metal and fiery conviction, Prime Vox is the charismatic [[Warforged]] revolutionary leading [[The Iron Sovereign]] in a war for construct liberation. Once a mere tool of war, he has forged himself into a symbol of defiance, preaching that constructs and [[Magitech]]-enhanced beings will never be free under organic rule.

Vox is more than just a warrior—he is a prophet of steel, spreading his message through coded transmissions and subversive magitech signals that rally lost Warforged and rogue constructs to his cause. From the small fortress-city of [[Crucible Prime]], he orchestrates raids, sabotage, and open conflict against those who would enslave, dismantle, or exploit his people.

His followers see him as a visionary, but his enemies fear him as a relentless zealot, willing to burn the world to build a new one where machines rule themselves. Whether he is a liberator or a tyrant depends on who tells the story—but in his mind, there is only one future: a world where steel is no longer bound by flesh.
