# Sibrek Hollowspore the Mycotyrant Artificer

Sibrek Hollowspore was once a disenfranchised [[Arkanitech Guild]] biomancer, cast out for delving too deeply into the forbidden overlap of necromancy and artifice. He found solace in the underbelly of Stickyickistan, where the [[Zooka Mire Collective]] welcomed his heretical fusion of magitechnology and decay. His experiments led to the birth of Fungoid Warforged known as [[Mycoforged]]. Beings that are neither truly alive nor dead, sustained by pulsating mycelium networks instead of arcane cores.

Operating from [[The Mycotic Forge]] hidden deep within the [[Zooka Mire Collective]]'s domain, Sibrek scours battlefields and scrapyards for discarded Warforged husks, resurrecting them as Mycoforged, beings whose bodies are encased in creeping lichen and armored fungal plating. His ultimate goal? To spread a [[Sporeborne Legion]], a hybrid of Zooka Mire rot and mechanized endurance—an unkillable army that grows stronger with every death.

However, Sibrek’s creations hunger. The symbiotic fungi within them require organic matter to thrive, and as they consume, they change, evolving in unpredictable and grotesque ways. Some whisper that Sibrek himself is no longer entirely human, his own flesh riddled with parasitic mycelium, his veins pulsing with the lifeblood of the mire.

He doesn’t mind. He’s long since accepted the inevitable truth: In the end, all things rot… and all rot is reborn.
